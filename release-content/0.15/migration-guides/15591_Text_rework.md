The `Text` API in Bevy has been overhauled in several ways as part of Bevy 0.15.
There are several major changes to consider:

- `ab_glyph` has been replaced with `cosmic-text`. These changes are mostly internal and the majority of users will not interact with either text backend directly.
- each text section is now stored as a distinct entity within the standard hierarchy, rather than as a `Vec<TextSection>` on the `Text` component. Children of `Text`/`Text2d` entities with `TextSpan` components will act as additional text sections.
- like other aspects of Bevy's API, required components have replaced bundles

#### `TextBundle` and text styling

`TextBundle` has been removed.
Add the `Text` component to set the string displayed.

`TextLayout`, `TextFont` and `TextColor` are required components for `Text`,
and are automatically added whenever `Text` is.
Set those values to change the text section's style.

Like elsewhere in Bevy, there is no style inheritance. Consider [writing your own abstraction for this](https://github.com/viridia/thorium_ui/blob/main/crates/thorium_ui_controls/src/text_styles.rs) if this is something you'd like to use.

To control the layout of a `Text` section, modify the properties of its `Node`.

#### Accessing text spans by index

Previously, text sections were elements of a vector stored within `Text`.
Now, they are stored as distinct entities under the same `Parent`.
You can use the new `TextUiReader` and `TextUiWriter` system parameters to conveniently access text spans by index.

Before:

```rust
fn refresh_text(mut query: Query<&mut Text, With<TimeText>>, time: Res<Time>) {
    let text = query.single_mut();
    text.sections[1].value = format_time(time.elapsed());
}
```

After:

```rust
fn refresh_text(
    query: Query<Entity, With<TimeText>>,
    mut writer: TextUiWriter,
    time: Res<Time>
) {
    let entity = query.single();
    *writer.text(entity, 1) = format_time(time.elapsed());
}
```

2D equivalents (`Text2dReader` and `Text2dWriter`) also exist.

#### Internal layout information

`TextBundle` additional fields have been moved into the `TextNodeFlags` component,
while `Text2dBundle`'s additional fields turned into the `TextBounds` and `Anchor` components.
