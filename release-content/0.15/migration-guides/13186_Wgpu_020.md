- Updated to `wgpu` 0.20, `naga` 0.20, and `naga_oil` 0.14
- All of Nagaâ€™s [`Capabilities`](https://docs.rs/naga/latest/naga/valid/struct.Capabilities.html) should now be properly detected and supported.
- Timestamps inside encoders are now disallowed on WebGPU to follow the spec (they still work on native). Use the `TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_ENCODERS ` wgpu feature to check for support.
- You can now use many numeric built-ins in `const` contexts (eg. `abs`, `cos`, `floor`, `max`, etc, see https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/v0.20/CHANGELOG.md#wgsl-const-evaluation-for-many-more-built-ins for the whole list)
- You can now use Subgroup operations in shaders on supported hardware (see https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/v0.20/CHANGELOG.md#subgroup-operations for limitations and which features to check)
- `u64` and `i64` are now supported in shaders on supported hardware (requires the `SHADER_INT64 ` feature, supported on desktop Vulkan, DX12 with DXC, and Metal with MSL 2.3+)
