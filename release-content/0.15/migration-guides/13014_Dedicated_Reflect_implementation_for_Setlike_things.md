- The new `Set` variants on the enums listed in the change section should probably be considered by people working with this level of the lib

__Help wanted!__

I’m not sure if this change is able to break code. From my understanding it shouldn’t since we just add functionality but I’m not sure yet if theres anything missing from my impl that would be normally provided by `impl_reflect_value!`
