<!-- Pack multiple vertex and index arrays together into growable buffers. -->

<!-- TODO -->

**Bevy 0.15** changes the way meshes are stored on the GPU to greatly improve CPU performance. Instead of using separate vertex and index buffers for every mesh as is done in Bevy 0.14, now they are coalesced respectively into 'slabs' of configurable size. This cuts down on how frequently we need to change bind groups, winning us up to 2x speedups!

The `MeshAllocatorSettings` resource allows tuning slab sizes, growth rate, and cut-offs to best fit your application's needs. The defaults should already be a significant win for most scenes.

WebGL2 does not support packing vertex buffers together, so only index buffers get combined on this platform.

Some measurements on the [Bistro] scene:

Overall frame time improves from 8.74 ms to 5.53 ms (1.58x speedup)
Render system time improves from 6.57 ms to 3.54 ms (1.86x speedup)
Opaque pass time improves from 4.64 ms to 2.33 ms (1.99x speedup)
