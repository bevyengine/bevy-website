The new `Readback` component simplifies the tricky process of getting data back from the GPU to the CPU using an observer based API.

```rust
commands.spawn(Readback::buffer(buffer.clone())).observe(
    |trigger: Trigger<ReadbackComplete>| {
        let data = trigger.event().to_shader_type();
        // ...
    },
);
```

When spawned into the main world the `Readback` component will queue a `Handle<Image>` or `Handle<ShaderStorageBuffer>` to be asynchronously read and copied back from the GPU to CPU in a future frame. 

This is especially useful for debugging, saving GPU-generated data, or performing CPU-side computations with results from the GPU. Itâ€™s perfect for scenarios where you need to analyze simulation data, capture rendered frames, or process large datasets on the GPU and retrieve the results for further use on the CPU.
