<!-- Add features to switch `NativeActivity` and `GameActivity` usage -->
<!-- https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12095 -->
Bevy now uses `GameActivity` as the default `Activity` for Android projects, replacing
`NativeActivity`. `NativeActivity` is still available, but has been placed behind a feature flag.

This change updates Bevy to a more modern Android stack, and includes an SDK minimum version bump to
[PlayStore's current version
requirement](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk). We've also
switched to a [`cargo-ndk`](https://docs.rs/crate/cargo-ndk/3.5.4) based build, which gives us more control by default. Gradle projects for both `GameActivity` and
`NativeActivity` are provided.

`GameActivity` brings with it improvements to game interaction (`SurfaceView` rendering, improved
touch and input handling), more frequent updates, and access to other parts of the
[JetPack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) ecosystem. It is better placed to integrate with
Rust code without excessive JNI wrangling. You can read more about `GameActivity`
[here](https://developer.android.com/games/agdk/game-activity).
