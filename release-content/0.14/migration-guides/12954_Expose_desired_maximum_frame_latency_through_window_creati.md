The `desired_maximum_frame_latency` field has been added to `Window` and `ExtractedWindow`. It is an `Option<NonZero<u32>>` that hints the maximum number of queued frames allowed on the GPU. Higher values may result in smoother frames and avoids freezes due to CPU-GPU data upload, but all at the cost of higher input latency. Setting `desired_maximum_frame_latency` to `None` will make it fall back to the default value, which is currently 2.
