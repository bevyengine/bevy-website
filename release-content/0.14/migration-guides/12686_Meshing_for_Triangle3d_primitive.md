The UV-mapping of `Triangle2d` has changed with this PR: the main difference is that the UVs are no longer dependent on the triangleâ€™s absolute coordinates but instead follow translations of the triangle itself in its definition. If you depended on the old UV-coordinates for `Triangle2d`, then you will have to update affected areas to use the new ones which can be briefly described as follows:

- The first coordinate is parallel to the line between the first two vertices of the triangle.
- The second coordinate is orthogonal to this, pointing in the direction of the third point.

Generally speaking, this means that the first two points will have coordinates `[_, 0.]`, while the third coordinate will be `[_, 1.]`, with the exact values depending on the position of the third point relative to the first two. For acute triangles, the first two vertices always have UV-coordinates `[0., 0.]` and `[1., 0.]` respectively. For obtuse triangles, the third point will have coordinate `[0., 1.]` or `[1., 1.]`, with the coordinate of one of the two other points shifting to maintain proportionality.

For example: 

- The default `Triangle2d` has UV-coordinates `[0., 0.]`, `[0., 1.]`, [`0.5, 1.]`.
- The triangle with vertices `vec2(0., 0.)`, `vec2(1., 0.)`, `vec2(2., 1.)` has UV-coordinates `[0., 0.]`, `[0.5, 0.]`, `[1., 1.]`.
- The triangle with vertices `vec2(0., 0.)`, `vec2(1., 0.)`, `vec2(-2., 1.)` has UV-coordinates `[2./3., 0.]`, `[1., 0.]`, `[0., 1.]`.
