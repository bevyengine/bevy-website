Bevy now depends on `wgpu` 0.20, `naga` 0.20, and `naga_oil` 0.14. If you manually specify any of these crates in your `Cargo.toml`, make sure to update their versions to prevent them from being duplicated.

Furthermore, timestamps inside of encoders are now disallowed on WebGPU (though they still work on native). Use the `TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_ENCODERS` feature to check for support.
