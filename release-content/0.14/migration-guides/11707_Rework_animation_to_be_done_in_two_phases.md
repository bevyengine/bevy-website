`AnimationClip` now uses UUIDs instead of hierarchical paths based on the `Name` component to refer to bones. This has several consequences:

- A new component, `AnimationTarget`, should be placed on each bone that you wish to animate, in order to specify its UUID and the associated `AnimationPlayer`. The glTF loader automatically creates these components as necessary, so most uses of glTF rigs shouldnâ€™t need to change.
- Moving a bone around the tree, or renaming it, no longer prevents an `AnimationPlayer` from affecting it.
- Dynamically changing the `AnimationPlayer` component will likely require manual updating of the `AnimationTarget` components.

Entities with `AnimationPlayer` components may now possess descendants that also have `AnimationPlayer` components. They may not, however, animate the same bones.

Furthermore, `NoOpTypeIdHash` and `NoOpTypeIdHasher` have been renamed to `NoOpHash` and `NoOpHasher`.
