Duplicate `MeshVertexBufferLayout`s are now combined into a single object, `MeshVertexBufferLayoutRef`, which contains an atomically-reference-counted (`Arc`) pointer to the layout. By interning these layouts, the results of `PartialEq` can be cached, resulting in a speedup in rendering. Code that was using `MeshVertexBufferLayout` may need to be updated to use `MeshVertexBufferLayoutRef` instead.
