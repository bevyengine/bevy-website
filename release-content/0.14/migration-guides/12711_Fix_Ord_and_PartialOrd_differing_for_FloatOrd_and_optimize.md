`FloatOrd`'s `PartialOrd` implementation used to differ in behavior from its `Ord` implementation, but it has since been fixed so they both now match. The current implementation of `PartialOrd` will never return `None`, as it now falls back to the `Ord` implementation. If you depended on this mismatched behavior, consider using the `PartialOrd` implementation on the inner `f32`.
