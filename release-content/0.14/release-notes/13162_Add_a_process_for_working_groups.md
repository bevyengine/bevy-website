Bevy has a ton of incredibly talented contributors, so keeping track of what's going on and making informed decisions can be a real challenge.
We're experimenting with [working groups]: ad hoc groups tackling harder issues by creating a design document, getting sign-off from the experts and then implement it.
If you'd like to help make complex, high-impact changes to Bevy: join or form a working group!
