`WindowMode::SizedFullscreen(MonitorSelection)` and `WindowMode::Fullscreen(MonitorSelection)` has become `WindowMode::Fullscreen(MonitorSelection, VideoModeSelection)`. Previously, the VideoMode was selected based on the closest resolution to the current window size for SizedFullscreen and the largest resolution for Fullscreen. It is possible to replicate that behaviour by searching `Monitor::video_modes` and selecting it with `VideoModeSelection::Specific(VideoMode)` but it is recommended to use `VideoModeSelection::Current` as the default video mode when entering fullscreen.
