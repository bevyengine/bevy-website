- `AudioSinkPlayback`â€™s `toggle` method has been renamed to `toggle_playback`. This was done to create consistency with the `toggle_mute` method added in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/16813. Change instances of `toggle` to `toggle_playback`. E.g.:

Before:

```rust
fn pause(keyboard_input: Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>, sink: Single<&AudioSink>) {
    if keyboard_input.just_pressed(KeyCode::Space) {
        sink.toggle();
    }
}
```

After:

```rust
fn pause(keyboard_input: Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>, sink: Single<&AudioSink>) {
    if keyboard_input.just_pressed(KeyCode::Space) {
        sink.toggle_playback();
    }
}
```
