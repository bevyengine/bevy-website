The cubic splines API now uses `IntoIterator` in places where it used `Into<Vec<..>>`. For most users, this will have little to no effect (it is largely more permissive). However, in case you were using some unusual input type that implements `Into<Vec<..>>` without implementing `IntoIterator`, you can migrate by converting the input to a `Vec<..>` before passing it into the interface.
