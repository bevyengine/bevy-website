<!-- Trait tags on docs.rs -->
<!-- https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17758 -->

Being a framework, Bevy provides several traits that define how a type is used â€“ for example, to attach data to an entity, it must implement `Component`. When reading the docs, that meant scrolling down to the type's trait implementation section and searching for relevant traits. With 0.16 however, on docs.rs, Bevy displays labels indicating which relevant a type implements:

This happens for the traits
Plugin / PluginGroup,
Component,
Resource,
Asset,
Event,
ScheduleLabel,
SystemSet,
SystemParam,
Relationship and
RelationshipTarget.

If you want to add these to your own crate, check out [these instructions](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/release-0.16.0/docs-rs).
