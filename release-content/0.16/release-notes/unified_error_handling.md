Bevy has historically left error handling as an exercise for the user. Many Bevy APIs return Results / errors, but Bevy ECS systems and commands did not themselves support returning Results / errors. Additionally, Bevy provides some "shorthand" panicking APIs that require less typing than unwrapping results. These things encouraged developers to write overly panick-ey behavior, even when that wasn't desired.

Ideally developers can _choose_ whether or not their systems should panic. For example, panic while you are developing to discover errors quickly (and force you to solve them), but when deploying to production just print errors to a console to avoid disrupting the user's experience.

**Bevy 0.16** introduces a new unified paradigm for error handling to help you ship crash-free games (and other applications!)
without sacrificing the loud-and-fast development that panics enable.

We've prioritized a simple and consistent design, with a few bells and whistles for easier debugging:

- Bevy systems, observers, and commands now support returning [`Result`], which is a type alias for `Result<(), BevyError>`
- [`Result`] expects the new [`BevyError`], which accepts any error type (much like [`anyhow`]). This makes it easy and ergonomic to use the [`?` operator] in systems / observers / commands to capture and return errors.
- [`BevyError`] automatically captures [high quality custom backtraces]. By default these are filtered down to just the essentials, cutting down on a lot of the noise from Rust and Bevy internals.
- Errors returned by systems, observers, and commands are now handled by the [`GLOBAL_ERROR_HANDLER`]. This defaults to panicking, but can be set to anything (log, panic, custom logic, etc). We generally encourage developing with the panicking default, then switching to logging errors when deploying to production.

We now encourage developers to bubble up errors whenever possible, rather than panicking immediately where the error occurs.

Instead of:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn move_player(mut query: Query<&mut Transform, With<Player>>) {
    let mut player_transform = query.single_mut().unwrap();
    player_transform.translation.x += 1.0;
}
```

Try:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn move_player(mut query: Query<&mut Transform, With<Player>>) -> Result {
    let mut player_transform = query.single_mut()?;
    player_transform.translation.x += 1.0;
    Ok(())
}
```
