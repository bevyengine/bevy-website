Virtual geometry (the `meshlet` cargo feature) is Bevy's Nanite-like rendering system, allowing much greater levels of geometry density than is otherwise possible, and freeing artists from manually creating LODs.

In **Bevy 0.16**, virtual geometry got some performance improvements thanks to new algorithms and GPU APIs.

Read more details on the [author's blog post](https://jms55.github.io/posts/2025-03-27-virtual-geometry-bevy-0-16).

Users are not required to regenerate their [`MeshletMesh`](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.16/bevy/pbr/experimental/meshlet/struct.MeshletMesh.html) assets, but doing so is recommended in order to take advantage of the improved clustering algorithm in **Bevy 0.16**.
