## Zola

The Bevy website is built using the Zola static site engine. In our experience, it is fast, flexible, and straightforward to use.

To check out any local changes you've made:

1. [Download Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).
2. Clone the Bevy Website git repo and enter that directory:
   1. `git clone https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website.git`
   2. `cd bevy-website`
3. Start the Zola server with `zola serve`.

A local server should start and you should be able to access a local version of the website from there.
