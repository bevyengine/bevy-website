## I donated at a level that lets me add my name / link / logo to the credits. How do I do that?

Tiers that support names and links allow you to specify them directly in the Stripe form. If you did not do this, contact us at <bevyengine@gmail.com> with that information and we'll get you added!

Tiers that support logos require reaching out to <bevyengine@gmail.com>. Send us your logo and your link and we'll add you!

## How do I cancel my donation subscription?

If you paid through Stripe (currently the only way to set up a donation subscription), just [visit this link](https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/7sI3ee5OXbI7dgIaEE) and enter the email you used to set up the subscription.

## I donated at a tier that adds me to the credits, can I use whatever name / logo / link I want?

We reserve the right to refuse to list any name / link / logo for any reason. If it is obnoxious, offensive, rude, or a violation of our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), expect us to refuse to list it.

Please only use names, logos, and links that you have the right and permission to use.

## I sponsored but the metrics / names / logos on the donate page haven't updated!

Please wait a little. It might take up to an hour for the automatic update to add you to the credits.

## How are the metrics on the donation page calculated?

The monthly dollar amount is the "raw pledged amount for active monthly donations". This means two things:

1. This number is "pre Stripe fees". This includes credit card fees and Stripes "processing fees", which vary per payment type.
2. This is the amount we _expect_ to get each month. In practice the payouts will be less, once chargebacks and cancellations are processed.
