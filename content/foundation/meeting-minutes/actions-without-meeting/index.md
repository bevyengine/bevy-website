<!-- more -->

Not all actions taken by the board require a formal meeting!
For the sake of transparency though, we've recorded the actions of the board performed without a meeting here, in chronological order.

The language here is often informal, but as Secretary I've aimed to capture it directly using `[]` brackets to fill in missing context.

Only actions where a vote occurs is recorded, and all such votes will be reported (along with the votes of each board member), regardless of if an initiative passes.
Generally speaking, the Bevy maintainers only act "as the board" when handling foundation business, and vote on matters of relatively high importance or those involving finances.
Ordinary moderation decisions don't rise to the level of the board, and technical discussion is handled in the open.

The board acts with a majority vote, and a recorded "unanimous" vote means that all board members at the time voted the same way with no absences or abstentions.
