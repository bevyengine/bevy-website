![Deprecating legacy sponsors](deprecating_legacy_sponsors.png)

**Proposal:** Also: I think it is time to deprecate the "legacy sponsors" section. I've prepped [a branch](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/pull/1564) but I won't create the PR until we agree

**Proposed by:** Carter Anderson

**Votes:** Yes by Alice I. Cecile, Rob Swain and Fran√ßois Mockers. No vote from Carter Anderson or James Liu.
