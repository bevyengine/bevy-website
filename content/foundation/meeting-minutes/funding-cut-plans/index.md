![Funding Cut Plans](funding_cut_plans.png)

**Proposal:** Carter Anderson proposes:

> Open source funding can be unstable. The foundation needs a plan to handle drops in funding in a way that is best for the health of the organization. Salaries are already currently below our desired targets. We have already on occasion opportunistically increased salaries as the budget allows, and there is an understanding / agreement among employees that these will fluctuate based on the financials of the foundation. I propose formalizing the following plan:
> 
> 1. Periodically (and opportunistically, as the need arises) raise or lower salaries based on our budget calculator (currently expressed in the Budget document on our google drive).
> 2. If this ever results in a drop below the "minimum viable yearly salary" (determined by the board), we will first cut non-critical programs and employees (as voted on by the board). If this is not enough to retain the remaining employees at the "minimum viable yearly salary", we will then enter a "part time" phase.
> 3. In the "part time phase", employees (that choose to stay) will scale back their hours by the amount required to balance the budget. By default this is done equally, unless an employee volunteers to give up their hours to the pool, or the board determines otherwise. If hours can be reduced no more (as determined by the board), employees will then be severed in an order determined by the board.

**Votes:** Yes from Rob Swain, Carter Anderson, Alice I. Cecile, François Mockers and James Liu.
