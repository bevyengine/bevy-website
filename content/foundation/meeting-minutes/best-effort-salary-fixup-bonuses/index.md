**Proposal:** Carter Anderson proposes:

> The foundation cannot currently pay Alice and Carter their target salaries. As such, they have been taking significant paycuts over the past year (and Carter worked fully unpaid prior to bringing him on at the end of March). However the financial health of the foundation has improved over the course of the last year, and we have been very conservative in our salaries, in the interest of building up our reserves. We have reached a point where we can afford to "right the scales", to the best of our ability, while still retaining reserves to ensure some level of continuity in the event of a reduction in donations.
>
> We should take the foundation's current savings, subtract what is necessary for the foundation's reserves, and divide the remaining amount in two, to be paid as "best-effort salary fixup" bonuses to Alice and Carter, for the last year of work.
>
> The calculated "total cost to the foundation" amount to be paid to both Alice and Carter is $31,030.40.
>
> This is calculated by taking the foundation's current savings ($96,360.80), subtracting one year of allocated conference cost allowances ($2000), and subtracting a two month operational cost buffer ($32,300).
> 
> Accounting for foundation-side taxes and fees, the bonuses to be paid out to each individual are:
> - Alice should be paid $28,274.33 (USD) / $39,633.53 (CAD)
> - Carter should be paid $28,660.41 (USD)

**Context:** This spreadsheet is not currently public, but we intend to make an updated budget available in January 2026.

**Votes:** Yes from Rob Swain, François Mockers, and James Liu. Carter Anderson and Alice I. Cecile abstain due to a conflict of interest.
