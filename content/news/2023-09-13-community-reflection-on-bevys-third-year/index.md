[@cart](https://www.twitter.com/cart_cart) here (Bevy's creator and Project Lead) with another update! A month ago was Bevy's Third Birthday! As is tradition, I took that as a chance to reflect on the past year and outline my hopes and dreams for the future. You can read that in my [Bevy's Third Birthday](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevys-third-birthday/) post.

This year for the first time I also encouraged the Bevy community to write their own reflections on Bevy's third year in a similar style, and to [post them here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/issues/728).

## What is Bevy?

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. We have a [Quick Start Guide](/learn/book/getting-started/) and a [Bevy Book](/learn/book/introduction/). You can also check out [Bevy Assets](/assets/) for a library of community-developed plugins, crates, games, and learning resources.
