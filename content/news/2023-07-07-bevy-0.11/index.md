Thanks to **X** contributors, **X** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous sponsors**](/community/donate), we're happy to announce the **Bevy 0.11** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/book/getting-started/) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.

To update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to **Bevy 0.11**, check out our [0.10 to 0.11 Migration Guide](/learn/migration-guides/0.10-0.11/).

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

* **Morph targets**: Vertex-based animations

## Morph Targets

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @nicopap, @cart</div>

Bevy, since the 0.7 release, supports 3D animations.

But it only supported _skeletal_ animations. Leaving on the sidewalk a common
animation type called _morph targets_ (aka blendshapes, aka keyshapes, and a slew
of other name). This is the grandparent of all 3D character animation!
[Crash Bandicoot]'s run cycle used morph targets.

Nowadays, an animation artist will typically use a skeleton rig for wide
moves and morph targets to clean up the detailed movements.

When it comes to game assets, however, the complex skeleton rigs used by
artists for faces and hands are too heavy. Usually, the poses are
"baked" into morph poses, and facial expression transitions are handled
in the engine through morph targets.

Morph targets is a very simple animation method. Take a model, have a base
vertex position, move the vertices around to create several poses:

<div style="flex-direction:row;display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly">
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;width:20%"><p><b>Default</b></p><img alt="A wireframe rendering of a character's face with a neutral expression" src="default-pose-bw.png"></div>
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;width:20%"><p><b>Frown</b></p><img alt="Wireframe rendering of a frowning character" src="frown-pose-bw.png"></div>
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;width:20%"><p><b>Smirk</b></p><img alt="Wireframe rendering of a smirking character" src="smirk-pose-bw.png"></div>
</div>

Store those poses as a difference between the default base mesh and the variant
pose, then, at runtime, _mix_ each pose. Now that we have the difference with
the base mesh, we can get the variant pose by simply adding to the base
vertices positions.

That's it, the morph target shader looks like this:

```rust
fn morph_vertex(vertex: Vertex) {
    for (var i: u32 = 0u; i < pose_count(); i++) {
        let weight = weight_for_pose(i);
        vertex.position += weight * get_difference(vertex.index, position_offset, i);
        vertex.normal += weight * get_difference(vertex.index, normal_offset, i);
    }
}
```

In Bevy, we store the weights per pose in the `MorphWeights` component.

```rust
fn set_weights_system(mut morph_weights: Query<&mut MorphWeights>) {
    for mut entity_weights in &mut morph_weights {
        let weights = entity_weights.weights_mut();

        weights[0] = 0.5;
        weights[1] = 0.25;
    }
}
```

Now assuming that we have two morph targets, (1) the frown pose, (2)
the smirk pose:

<div style="flex-direction:row;display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly">
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;width:12%">
  <p><b>[0.0, 0.0]</b></p>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:75%">default pose</p>
  <img alt="Neutral face expression" src="morph_target_default-0.png">
</div>
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;width:12%">
  <p><b>[1.0, 0.0]</b></p>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:75%">frown only</p>
  <img alt="Frowning" src="morph_target_frown-0.png">
</div>
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;width:12%">
  <p><b>[0.0, 1.0]</b></p>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:75%">smirk only</p>
  <img alt="Smirking" src="morph_target_smirk.png">
</div>
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;width:12%">
  <p><b>[0.5, 0.0]</b></p>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:75%">half frown</p>
  <img alt="Slightly frowning" src="morph_target_frown-half-0.png">
</div>
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;width:12%">
  <p><b>[1.0, 1.0]</b></p>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:75%">both at max</p>
  <img alt="Making faces" src="morph_target_both-0.png">
</div>
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;width:12%">
  <p><b>[0.5, 0.25]</b></p>
  <p style="margin:0;font-size:75%">bit of both</p>
  <img alt="Slightly frowning/smirking" src="morph_target_smirk-quarter-frown-half-0.png">
</div>
</div>

While conceptually simple, it requires communicating to the GPU a tremendous
amount of data. Thousand of vertices, each 288 bits, several model variations,
sometimes a hundred.

Bevy's morph target implementation is similar to BabyloneJS's. We store the
vertex data as pixels in a 3D texture. This allows morph targets to not only
run on WebGPU, but also on the WebGL2 wgpu backend.

This could be improved in a number of ways, but it is sufficient for an
initial implementation.
