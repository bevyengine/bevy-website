[Contributing to Bevy](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction/) is a blast, but what if you could meet each other in flesh?

[RustWeek 2025](https://rustweek.org/) has generously offered to let Bevy (among other Rust-affiliated groups!) nest into a room (plus a breakout room!) as part of their [Unconf](https://rustweek.org/unconf/). Three days of socializing, collaborating and working on Bevy, in whatever form we'd like!

<!-- more -->

Now, for the details:

- **Who:** Anyone who is actively contributing to Bevy or the surrounding Rust game dev ecosystem.
  - If you're focused on Bevy's dependencies (`winit`, `wgpu` and so many more) please come hang out with us: we'd love to have you!
  - Experienced users are welcome too: share your hopes, dreams, complaints and frustrations about Bevy
  - If you have dietary restrictions or need accommodations of any form, please reach out to the RustWeek organizers and we'll do our best to meet your needs.
- **What:** work on Bevy building and improving your favorite open source Rust game engine.
  - What exactly will we work on? Who knows!
  - There will be mad science.
  - We will write docs.
  - It *will* be fun.
- **Where:** Utrecht, The Netherlands
  - De Utrechtse Stadsvrijheid, to be exact.
  - If you need help with letters of invitation or visas, let us know ASAP and we'll help get you sorted.
- **When:** May 16th and 17th, 2025
  - That's Friday and Saturday, with a bonus event on Thursday afternoon and evening.
  - The conference beforehand is great (Alice is giving a talk!), but totally optional.
  - Unconf attendees also invited to the 10 Years of Rust Celebration beforehand on May 15th!
- **How much:** Free!
  - You do need to pay for your own travel and lodging. We'll help coordinate hotel sharing for those who are interested.
  - Renting a bike is recommended: the Netherlands is great fun with one and it was extremely useful for RustNL 2024. We'll try to coordinate a group deal!
  - Bevy and RustWeek (with your help!) would like to offer whatever financial support we can to contributors who need it: email or DM us if this would make life easier for you <3

If you'd like to attend, add yourself to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-WwFHj2GdZ8quon7V5z8XNVQDDYvme7_-QzfBGelRBA/edit?usp=sharing). We have limited slots (about 20), and people need to make travel arrangements: please be considerate when indicating your level of committedness! If you later find you cannot attend, please remove yourself from this list so we can free up space for others.

Maintainers and SMEs will be prioritized, but beyond that, selection will be random. After the spreadsheet has been live for a week, we'll go through the list (sorted by committedness, then randomly within that) and get a final confirmation from each person who has signed up before forwarding the final attendee list to the RustWeek organizers.

We're incredibly grateful for this opportunity, and would love to help defray the costs for the organizers and have funds to support contributors with travel costs. If you or your company would like to provide funds for this, read over the [sponsorship prospectus](https://rustweek.org/resources/sponsorship-prospectus-rustweek-2025.pdf) that they've provided to us. To coordinate the details, email us at `support@bevy.org` + `sponsors@rustnl.org`.

That's all for now: see you in the Netherlands!

P.S. Bevy can also [select one side-track talk for the main conference](https://rustweek.org/unconf/#conf). If you're interested in attending the conference, and would like to give a talk to a broader audience, please let us know!
