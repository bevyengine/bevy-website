Thanks to **X** contributors, **X** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous sponsors**](/community/donate), we're happy to announce the **Bevy 0.12** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/book/getting-started/) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.

To update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to **Bevy 0.12**, check out our [0.11 to 0.12 Migration Guide](/learn/migration-guides/0.11-0.12/).

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

## Spatial Audio API Ergonomics

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @rparrett, @hymm, @mockersf</div>

Spatial audio was heroically [put together](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-10/#spatial-audio) at the last minute for Bevy 0.10, but the implementation was somewhat bare-bones and not very user-friendly. Users needed to write their own systems to update audio sinks with emitter and listener positions.

Now users can just add a `TransformBundle` to their `AudioBundle`s and Bevy will take care of the rest!

```rust
commands.spawn((
    TransformBundle::default(),
    AudioBundle {
        source: asset_server.load("sounds/bonk.ogg"),
        settings: PlaybackSettings::DESPAWN.with_spatial(true),
    },
));
```

## <a name="what-s-next"></a>What's Next?

We have plenty of work that is pretty much finished and is therefore very likely to land in **Bevy 0.13**:

Check out the [**Bevy 0.13 Milestone**](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/milestone/17) for an up-to-date list of current work being considered for **Bevy 0.13**.
