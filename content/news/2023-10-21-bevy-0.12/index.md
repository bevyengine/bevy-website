Thanks to **X** contributors, **X** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous sponsors**](/community/donate), we're happy to announce the **Bevy 0.12** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/book/getting-started/) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.

To update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to **Bevy 0.12**, check out our [0.11 to 0.12 Migration Guide](/learn/migration-guides/0.11-0.12/).

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

## Added HSL methods to `Color` struct

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @idedary</div>

You can now use `h()`, `s()`, `l()` together with their `set_h()`, `set_s()`, `set_l()` and `with_h()`, `with_s()`, `with_l()` variants to manipulate _Hue_, _Saturation_ and _Lightness_ values of a `Color` struct without cloning. Previously you could do that with only RGBA values.

```rust
// Returns HSL component values
let color = Color::ORANGE;
let hue = color.h();
// ...

// Changes the HSL component values
let mut color = Color::PINK;
color.set_s(0.5);
// ...

// Modifies existing colors and returns them
let color = Color::VIOLET.with_l(0.7);
// ...
```

We have plenty of work that is pretty much finished and is therefore very likely to land in **Bevy 0.13**:
