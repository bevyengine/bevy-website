Thanks to **X** contributors, **X** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous sponsors**](/community/donate), we're happy to announce the **Bevy 0.12** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/book/getting-started/) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.

To update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to **Bevy 0.12**, check out our [0.11 to 0.12 Migration Guide](/learn/migration-guides/0.11-0.12/).

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

## Ignore Ambiguous Components and Resources

Ambiguity Reporting is an optional feature of Bevy's scheduler. When enabled it reports conflicts between systems that modify the same data, but are not ordered in relation to each other. While some reported conflicts can cause subtle bugs, many do not. Bevy has a couple existing methods and two new ones for ignoring these.

The existing API's, `ambiguous_with` ignores conflicts between specific sets, and `ambigous_with_all` ignores all conflicts with the set it's applied to. In addition, there are now 2 new API's that let you ignore conflicts on a type of data, `allow_ambiguous_component` and `allow_ambiguous_resource`. These ignore all conflicts between systems on that specific type, component or resource, in a world.

```rust
#[derive(Resource)]
struct R;

// Rhese systems are ambiguous on R
fn system_1(_: ResMut<R>) {}
fn system_2(_: Res<R>) {}

let mut app = App::new();
app.configure_schedules(ScheduleBuildSettings {
  ambiguity_detection: LogLevel::Error,
  ..default()
});
app.insert_resource(R);

app.add_systems(Update, ( system_1, system_2 ));
app.allow_ambiguous_resource::<R>();

// Running the app does not error.
app.update();
```

Bevy is now using this to ignore conflicts between the `Assets<T>` resources. Most of these ambiguities are modifying different assets and thus do not matter.

We have plenty of work that is pretty much finished and is therefore very likely to land in **Bevy 0.13**:
