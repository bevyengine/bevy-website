Thanks to **X** contributors, **X** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous sponsors**](/community/donate), we're happy to announce the **Bevy 0.12** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/book/getting-started/) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.

To update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to **Bevy 0.12**, check out our [0.11 to 0.12 Migration Guide](/learn/migration-guides/0.11-0.12/).

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

<!-- more -->

## Feature Name

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @author</div>

## Limit Background FPS

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @maniwani</div>

If an app has no window in focus, Bevy will now limit its update rate (to 60Hz by default).

Before, many Bevy apps running on desktop operating systems (particularly macOS) would see spikes in CPU usage whenever their windows were minimized or completely covered, even with VSync enabled. The reason for this is that many desktop window managers ignore VSync for windows that aren't visible. As VSync normally limits how often an app updates, that speed limit vanishes while it's effectively disabled.

Now, apps running in the background will sleep in between updates to limit their FPS.

The one caveat is that most operating systems will not report if a window is visible, only if it has focus. So the throttle is based on focus, not visibility. 60Hz was then chosen as the default to maintain high FPS in cases where the window is not focused but still visible.

## `AnimationPlayer` API Improvements

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @devinleamy</div>

The `AnimationPlayer` now has new methods for controlling playback, and utilities for checking
if an animation is playing or completed, and getting its `AnimationClip` handle.

`set_elapsed` and has been removed in favor of `seek_to`. `elapsed` now
returns the actual elapsed time and is not affected by the animation speed. `stop_repeating` have been removed
in favor of `set_repeat(RepeatAnimation::Never)`.

```rust
let mut player = q_animation_player.single_mut();
// Check if an animation is complete.
if player.is_finished() {
    // Set the playback mode.
    player.set_repeat(RepeatAnimation::Forever);
    player.set_repeat(RepeatAnimation::Never);
    player.set_repeat(RepeatAnimation::Count(4));
}
// Get a handle to the playing AnimationClip.
let clip_handle = player.animation_clip();
// Seek to 1s in the current clip.
player.seek_to(1.0);
```

## Ignore Ambiguous Components and Resources

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @hymm</div>

Ambiguity Reporting is an optional feature of Bevy's scheduler. When enabled it reports conflicts between systems that modify the same data, but are not ordered in relation to each other. While some reported conflicts can cause subtle bugs, many do not. Bevy has a couple existing methods and two new ones for ignoring these.

The existing APIs: `ambiguous_with`, which ignores conflicts between specific sets, and `ambiguous_with_all`, which ignores all conflicts with the set it's applied to. In addition, there are now 2 new APIs that let you ignore conflicts on a type of data, `allow_ambiguous_component` and `allow_ambiguous_resource`. These ignore all conflicts between systems on that specific type, component or resource, in a world.

```rust
#[derive(Resource)]
struct R;

// These systems are ambiguous on R
fn system_1(_: ResMut<R>) {}
fn system_2(_: Res<R>) {}

let mut app = App::new();
app.configure_schedules(ScheduleBuildSettings {
  ambiguity_detection: LogLevel::Error,
  ..default()
});
app.insert_resource(R);

app.add_systems(Update, ( system_1, system_2 ));
app.allow_ambiguous_resource::<R>();

// Running the app does not error.
app.update();
```

Bevy is now using this to ignore conflicts between the `Assets<T>` resources. Most of these ambiguities are modifying different assets and thus do not matter.

## Spatial Audio API Ergonomics

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @rparrett, @hymm, @mockersf</div>

A simple "stereo" (non-HRTF) spatial audio implementation was heroically [put together](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-10/#spatial-audio) at the last minute for Bevy 0.10, but the implementation was somewhat bare-bones and not very user-friendly. Users needed to write their own systems to update audio sinks with emitter and listener positions.

Now users can just add a `TransformBundle` to their `AudioBundle`s and Bevy will take care of the rest!

```rust
commands.spawn((
    TransformBundle::default(),
    AudioBundle {
        source: asset_server.load("sounds/bonk.ogg"),
        settings: PlaybackSettings::DESPAWN.with_spatial(true),
    },
));
```

## Added HSL methods to `Color` struct

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @idedary</div>

You can now use `h()`, `s()`, `l()` together with their `set_h()`, `set_s()`, `set_l()` and `with_h()`, `with_s()`, `with_l()` variants to manipulate _Hue_, _Saturation_ and _Lightness_ values of a `Color` struct without cloning. Previously you could do that with only RGBA values.

```rust
// Returns HSL component values
let color = Color::ORANGE;
let hue = color.h();
// ...

// Changes the HSL component values
let mut color = Color::PINK;
color.set_s(0.5);
// ...

// Modifies existing colors and returns them
let color = Color::VIOLET.with_l(0.7);
// ...
```

## <a name="what-s-next"></a>What's Next?

We have plenty of work that is pretty much finished and is therefore very likely to land in **Bevy 0.13**:

Check out the [**Bevy 0.13 Milestone**](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/milestone/17) for an up-to-date list of current work being considered for **Bevy 0.13**.
