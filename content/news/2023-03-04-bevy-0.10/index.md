Thanks to **X** contributors, **X** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous sponsors**](/community/donate), I'm happy to announce the **Bevy 0.10** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/book/getting-started/) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.

To update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to **Bevy 0.10**, check out our [0.9 to 0.10 Migration Guide](/learn/book/migration-guides/0.9-0.10/).

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

## `Ref<T>` Queries

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @Guvante, @JoJoJet</div>

Since Bevy 0.1, `Mut<T>` has been used to enable change detection (along with related types like `ResMut<T>`). It's a simple wrapper type that provides mutable access to a component alongside its change tick metadata, automatically marking a change when the value is mutated.

In **Bevy 0.10**, the change detection family has grown with `Ref<T>`, the immutable variant of `Mut<T>`. Like its mutable sibling, it allows you to react to changes made outside of the current system.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn inspect_changes_system<T: Component + Debug>(q: Query<Ref<T>>) {
    // Iterate over each component of type `T` and log its changed status.
    for val in &q {
        if val.is_changed() {
            println!("Value `{val:?}` was last changed at tick {}.", val.last_changed());
        } else {
            println!("Value `{val:?}` is unchanged.");
        }
    }
}
```

We are also deprecating `ChangeTrackers<T>`, which is the old way of inspecting a component's change ticks. This type will be removed in the next version of Bevy.

## Android Support

Bevy now runs out of the box on Android on more devices. This was unlocked by waiting for the [`Resumed`](https://docs.rs/winit/0.28/winit/event/enum.Event.html#variant.Resumed) event to create the window instead of doing it on startup, matching the [`onResume()`](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle#onresume) callback on Android.

To follow the recommandations on the [`Suspended`](https://docs.rs/winit/0.28/winit/event/enum.Event.html#variant.Suspended) event, Bevy will now exit on receiving that event. This is a temporary solution until Bevy is able to recreate rendering resources when being resumed.

Please test on your devices and report successes or issues you may encounter! There is a known issue around touch position on some devices with software buttons, as winit doesn't expose [yet](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/2308) the inset size, only the inner size.

As this brings Bevy closer to full support of Android, there isn't a need anymore for separated examples for Android and iOS. They have been regrouped in one ["mobile" example](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/v0.10.0/examples/mobile), and the instructions updated ([for Android](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/v0.10.0/examples#android) and [for iOS](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/v0.10.0/examples#ios)).
