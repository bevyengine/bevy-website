In March we [announced the Bevy Foundation](/news/bevy-foundation/), our new non-profit dedicated to developing Bevy and teaching people how to use it. At that time, we applied for federal 501(c)(3) public charity status, which would give us tax-exempt status in the United States and make donations tax-deductible. It introduces stricter operational constraints that help protect the integrity of our mission and our community.

I am excited to announce that the Bevy Foundation has been granted 501(c)(3) public charity status!

<!-- more -->

## What does this mean for Bevy?

1. We are exempt from income tax on donations we receive (including the donations we have already received this year). This means 100% of the donations we receive go toward furthering our mission.
2. Donations to Bevy Foundation (including all past donations that occurred this year) are now tax-deductible in the United States.
3. Many employers have donation-matching programs for 501(c)(3)s. It is worth checking to see if your employer will match your donation!
4. There are many grant opportunities out there for 501(c)(3)s. These are now on the table for the Bevy Foundation.
5. We now must [operate under the constraints of a 501(c)(3) public charity](https://www.501c3.org/what-is-a-501c3/)
6. We must file a yearly report that outlines our activities (IRS form 990).

I am personally very excited about this. 501(c)(3) public charity status, because of its constraints, buys us more public trust than the more general state-level non-profit status. Each donation can go further, and there are now more opportunities for financial support!

## Every.org: our new donation platform

As a 501(c)(3) we are now qualified to use [Every.org](https://www.every.org/) as our donation platform. Every.org is _also_ a 501(c)(3) that exists to make 501(c)(3) fundraising as straightforward and cheap as possible. They take _no_ platform fees, and if you pay directly with a bank account, there are _literally_ zero fees. 100% of your donation goes to Bevy Foundation. If you pay with a credit card or a payment processor like Apple Pay, you still pay those platform fees, but they are as low as possible.

We still support Stripe (our old platform) to give people as many options as possible. But we now prefer Every.org and default to it where we can, as it provides _much_ better rates:

| | Every.org | Stripe |
| ----- | --------- | ------ |
| Bank Fee | 0% | 0.8% |
| Subscription Fee | 0% | 0.5% (increasing to 0.7% next year) |
| Card Fee | 2.2% + $0.30 | 2.2% + $0.30 |

These fees really add up over time, so using Every.org is a _huge_ win for us!

Every.org also supports easy one-time payments with custom amounts (an often requested feature). See our [expanded donation options](/donate/options) page for details.

## New Bevy Foundation Emails

As part of this announcement, we're also rolling out new `bevyengine.org` emails:

* <support@bevyengine.org>: The new way to ask Bevy leadership for support. This replaces `bevyengine@gmail.com`.
* <foundation@bevyengine.org>: The best way to reach Bevy Foundation board members.

The Bevy Maintainers / Bevy Foundation Board Members now also have individual `bevyengine.org` emails:

* Carter Anderson: <cart@bevyengine.org>
* Alice Cecile: <alice@bevyengine.org>
* Fran√ßois Mockers: <francois@bevyengine.org>
* Robert Swain: <rob@bevyengine.org>
* James Liu: <james@bevyengine.org>

## Please Donate!

With these changes, there has never been a better time to [donate to the Bevy Foundation](/donate). In addition to the default monthly donations, custom one-time donations are also now open, so if you were waiting for those ... now is the time to hop aboard!

Bevy will always be free and open-source, but it isn't free to make! Because Bevy is free, we rely on the generosity of the Bevy community to fund our efforts. If you are a happy user of Bevy or you believe in our mission, please consider [donating to the Bevy Foundation](/donate)... every bit helps!
