Thanks to **??** contributors, **???** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous donors**](/donate), we're happy to announce the **Bevy 0.16** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/quick-start) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.

To update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to **Bevy 0.16**, check out our [0.15 to 0.16 Migration Guide](/learn/migration-guides/0-15-to-0-16/).

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

- TODO

<!-- more -->

## What's Next?

The features above may be great, but what else does Bevy have in flight?
Peering deep into the mists of time (predictions are _extra_ hard when your team is almost all volunteers!), we can see some exciting work taking shape:

- TODO

{{ support_bevy() }}
{{ contributors(version="0.16") }}
{{ changelog(version="0.16")}}
