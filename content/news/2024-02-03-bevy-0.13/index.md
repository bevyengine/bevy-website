Thanks to **TODO** contributors, **TODO** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous sponsors**](/community/donate), we're happy to announce the **Bevy 0.13** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/book/getting-started/) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.
And to see what the engine has to offer hands-on, check out the entries in the [latest Bevy Jam](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-4/entries), including the winner [That's a lot of beeeeees](https://andrewb330.itch.io/thats-a-lot-of-beeeeees)

To update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to **Bevy 0.13**, check out our [0.12 to 0.13 Migration Guide](/learn/migration-guides/0.12-0.13/).

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

<!-- more -->

* **First-party primitive shapes:** basic shapes are a core building block of both game engines and video games: we've added a polished collection of them for you to use!
* **System stepping:** completely pause and advance through your game frame-by-frame or system-by-system to interactively debug game logic, all while rendering continues to update.
* **Dynamic queries:** refining queries from within systems is extremely expressive, and is the last big puzzle piece for runtime-defined types and third-party modding and scripting integration.
* **Automatically inferred command flush points:** tired of reasoning about where to put `apply_deferred` and confused about why your commands weren't being applied? Us too! Now, Bevy's scheduler uses ordinary `.before` and `.after` constraints and inspects the system parameters to automatically infer (and deduplicate) synchronization points.
* **Slicing, tiling and nine-patch sprites:** ninepatch layout is a popular tool for smoothly scaling stylized tilesets and UIs. Now in Bevy!
* **Lightmaps:** the first step towards baked global illumination: a fast, popular and pretty lighting technique.
* **Animation interpolation modes:** Bevy now supports non-linear interpolation modes in exported glTF animations.

## System Stepping

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @dmlary</div>

The new system stepping feature (`bevy_debug_stepping`) adds debugger-style
execution control for systems. The [`Stepping`] resource can control which
systems within a schedule execute each frame, and provides step, break, and
continue facilities to enable live debugging.

The `Stepping` resource is configured with a list of schedules that it will
control execution of when stepping is enabled. The collection of systems
within those schedules can be thought of as the stepping frame. It can take
multiple step or continue calls to traverse through the entire stepping frame.
During this time, all schedules that have not been added to `Stepping` are
executing each frame. This allows rendering & input handling to continue while
stepping through systems.

### Configuration

First, configure the [`Stepping`] resource and add it to the world:

```rust
// Create a new Stepping resource, and add schedules to debug
let mut stepping = Stepping::new();
stepping.add_schedule(Update);
stepping.add_schedule(FixedUpdate);
// Stepping is disabled by default,
// even when the resource is inserted.
// Feature flags, dev consoles and obscure hotkeys all work great.
#[cfg(feature = "my_stepping_flag")]
stepping.enable();

// add the Stepping resource to the world
app.insert_resource(stepping);
```

Systems within the added schedules will not be run unless we're performing
a system step, continuing the stepping frame, or the system has been exempt
from stepping.

### Execution Control: System Step & Continue Frame

While stepping is enabled, the `Stepping` resource tracks its location within
the stepping frame, maintaining a stepping cursor pointing at the next system
to be executed.
There are two ways systems get executed while stepping is enabled: system step,
and continue frame.

System step (`Stepping::step_frame()`) runs the system at the stepping
cursor, and advances the cursor during the next render frame.
This is useful to see individual changes made by
systems, and see the state of the world prior to executing a system

Continue frame (`Stepping::continue_frame()`) will execute systems starting
from the stepping cursor to the end of the stepping frame during the next frame.
It may stop before the end of the stepping frame if it encounters a system with
a breakpoint. This is useful for advancing quickly through an entire frame,
getting to the start of the next frame, or in combination with breakpoints.

In this video we demonstrate system step & continue frame on the breakout
example with a custom `egui` interface.  The stepping cursor can be seen moving through
the systems list as we click the `step` button.  When the `continue` button is
clicked, you can see the game progress one stepping frame for each click.

<video controls><source src="stepping-step-continue.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video>

### Breakpoints

When a schedule grows to a certain point, it can take a long time to step
through every system in the schedule just to see the effects of a few systems.
In this case, stepping provides system breakpoints.

You can set a breakpoint on those systems you care about, then use
`Stepping::continue_frame()` to run systems starting at the stepping cursor
until a breakpoint is encountered, or the end of the stepping frame.
If the stepping cursor points at a system with a breakpoint when you call
`Stepping::continue_frame()` that system will run.  This allows you to set
breakpoints through a system, and repeatedly continue the frame to stop prior
to each system of interest.

In this video of the breakout example, we add a breakpoint to
`check_for_collisions()` so we can verify the collision detection & handling
behavior each frame without stepping through all the other systems.

The video shows the stepping cursor moves from the start of the stepping frame
to `check_for_collisions()` the first time we click `continue` in the ui.  On
the next click, `check_for_collisions()` and all remaining systems are run,
moving the cursor back up to the start of the stepping frame.

<video controls><source src="stepping-breakpoint.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video>

### Disabling Systems

During debugging, it can be helpful to disable systems to narrow down the
source of the problem. `Stepping::never_run()` and `Stepping::never_run_node()`
can be used to disable systems while stepping is enabled. Note that disabling
systems in this manner only has an effect while stepping is enabled. When
stepping is disabled, all disabled systems will resume executing.

In this video of the breakout example, we disable the `check_for_collisions()`
system and use continue frame to move the ball into the center of the blocks,
then re-enable the system to have fun destroying all the blocks from the
inside.

<video controls><source src="stepping-disable-system.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video>

### Excluding Systems from Stepping

It may be necessary to ensure some systems still run while stepping is enabled.
While best-practice is to have them in a schedule that has not been added to
the `Stepping` resource, it is possible to configure systems to always run
while stepping is enabled. This is primarily useful for event & input handling
systems.

Systems can be configured to always run by calling
`Stepping::always_run()`, or `Stepping::always_run_node()`.
When a system is configured to always run, it will run each rendering frame
even when stepping is enabled.

In this video of the breakout example the `move_paddle()` system is configured
to always run.  We then use the arrow keys to move the paddle while the rest
of the game systems are stopped by stepping.  This allows us to position the
paddle precisely before continuing frame-by-frame as the ball impacts the
paddle.

<video controls><source src="stepping-run-always.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video>

### Limitations

In this initial implementation of stepping there are some limitations:

* Any system that reads events likely will not step properly
  * Frames still advance normally while stepping is enabled
  * Events can be cleared before a stepped system can read them
  * Best approach here is to configure event-based systems to always run,
    or put them in a schedule not added to `Stepping`
  * Continue with breakpoints may also work in this scenario
* Conditional systems may not run as expected when stepping
  * Similar to event-based systems, if the condition is true for only a short
    time, system may not run when stepped

## Query transmutation

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @hymm, james-j-obrien</div>

Have you every wanted to pass a query to a function, but instead of having a
`Query<&Transform>` you have a `Query<(&Transform, &Velocity), With<Enemy>>`?
Well now you can by using the `Query::transmute_lens` method. Query transmutes
allow you to change a query into different query types as long as the
components accessed are a subset of the original query. If you do try to access
data that is not in the original query, this method will panic.

```rust
fn reusable_function(lens: &mut QueryLens<&Transform>) {
    let query = lens.query();
    // do something with the query...
}

// We can use the function in a system that takes the exact query.
fn system_1(mut query: Query<&Transform>) {
    reusable_function(&mut query.as_query_lens());
}

// We can also use it with a query that does not match exactly
// by transmuting it.
fn system_2(mut query: Query<(&mut Transform, &Velocity), With<Enemy>>) {
    let mut lens = query.transmute_lens::<&Transform>();
    reusable_function(&mut lens);
}
```

Note that the `QueryLens` will still iterate over the same entities as the
original `Query` it is derived from. A `QueryLens<&Transform>` taken from
a `Query<(&Transform, &Velocity)>`, will only include the `Transform` of
entities with both `Transform` and `Velocity` components.

Besides removing parameters you can also change them in limited ways to the
different smart pointer types. One of the more useful is to change a
`& mut` to a `&`. See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/system/struct.Query.html#method.transmute_lens)
for more details.

One thing to take into consideration is the transmutation is not free.
It works by creating a new state and copying a bunch of the cached data
inside the original query. It's not a expensive operation, but you should
probably avoid doing it inside a hot loop.

## Entity Optimizations

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @Bluefinger, @notverymoe, @scottmcm, @bushrat011899, @james7132</div>

`Entity` (Bevy's 64-bit unique identifier for enitities) received a number of changes this cycle, combining laying some more groundwork for relations alongside _related_, and nice to have, performance optimizations. The work here involved a lot of deep-diving into compiler codegen/assembly output, with running lots of benchmarks and testing in order to ensure all changes didn't cause breakages or major problems. Although the work here was dealing with mostly _safe_ code, there were lots of underlying assumptions being changed that could have impacted code elsewhere. This was the most "micro-optimization" oriented set of changes in Bevy 0.13.

### Changing `Entity`'s Layout

The exact details of how those 64 bits get used changed repeatedly in 0.13.
First we have two PRs: "Unified Identifier for entities & relations" PR ([#9797](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/9797) by @Bluefinger) and "Change Entity::generation from u32 to NonZeroU32 for niche optimization" ([#9907](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/9907) by @notverymoe).
Fundamentally, they both involved changing the layout and assumptions of `Entity`, unlocking a building blocks for relations and improving memory/codegen for `Entity`.

[#9797](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/9797) created a new `Identifier` struct that set out a unified layout for `Entity` and future ID types. The `Identifier` spec lays out a struct with a `u32` low segment and a `u32` high segment, resulting in a struct that can be effectively represented as a special-cased `u64` value. A diagram of `Identifier` layout is as follows, going from Most Significant Bit to Lowest Significant Bit:

```text
| F   | High value / Generation | Low value / Index |
| --- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | 31 bits                 | 32 bits           |

F = Bit Flags
```

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct Identifier {
    low: u32,
    high: u32,
}
```

The low part can be used as a full `u32` value, but the high part consists of a packed `u32` structure, with the most significant bit reserved as a flag, and the remaining 31-bits to be used as a value. _How_ the low segment and the value part of the high segment are used is not specified by the `Identifer`, only that there are reserved bits in the high segment. This bit is reserved for the purposes of a future `Pair` identifier, which would represent a different _kind_ of identifier with separate semantics/usage compared to an `Entity`. The work here is basically an implementation of the prior art established by Flecs ([citation](https://ajmmertens.medium.com/doing-a-lot-with-a-little-ecs-identifiers-25a72bd2647)), as eventually, these new entities and entity kinds will be used to describe special component types needed for relations. In the future, more flag bits will be reserved at the cost of bits in the high segment.

But on top of this came [#9907](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/9907). This PR had the effect of changing both `Entity`/`Identifier` to have a high segment that was `NonZeroU32`:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct Identifier {
    low: u32,
    high: NonZeroU32,
}
```

By including a non-zero property within `Entity`/`Identifier`, it allowed the compiler to be able to optimise `Option<Entity>` to take 8 bytes instead of 12 bytes, as it could now use invalid representations of `Entity`/`Identifier` as the `None` equivalent. The benefit here was reduced memory/cache usage for storing `Option<Entity>` as well as better codegen around methods that use or return `Option<Entity>`. The choice to modify the generation/high segment to be non-zero had the following benefits: It allowed the low/index portion of `Entity` to be zero, so index access of `Entity` from storages/archetypes/buffers in hot code paths remained untouched. Code that touched the high segment or the generation in `Entity` was in less performance sensitive sections, and when spawning, most of that code would be exactly the same, but with initialising generation with a constant `1` instead of a `0`. For `Entity` however, incrementing a generation meant it needed to ensure that if an overflow occurred, it overflowed at 31-bits **and** also overflowed to `1` instead of `0`.

Moreover, this choice _did not interfere_ with the unified `Identifier` approach. While for `Entity`, the generation would have to be initialised with `1`; for other ID types, the high segment would always be _non-zero_ due to flag bits being set. That means a `Pair` type (which would have an ID in both high and low segments) would be unaffected as it could reference an `Entity` id in the low segment, and have its own id in the high segment.

### Optimizing `Entity` further

Part two of the `Entity` optimization story continues with initial work on improving `Entity`'s `PartialEq` implementation ([#10519](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10519) by @scottmcm). With `Entity`'s structure, the standard `PartialEq` derive was yielding poor codegen and leaving performance on the table as the compiler was unable to make the correct inferences on how to load `Entity` for comparisons. By removing the short-circuiting implementation that is the default for `PartialEq` derivation, the compiler could output much less assembly for the same operation, yielding performance improvements in both ECS and rendering code.

However, work in this area did not stop with [#10519](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10519). Code generation was still poor, motivating "Optimise Entity with repr align & manual PartialOrd/Ord" ([#10558](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10558) by @Bluefinger). Similar work had been attempted before: ([#2372](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/2372) & [#3788](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3788)) but these didn't get merged due to complexity, unclear performance benefits and interactions with existing PRs.

By default, `Entity`/`Identifier`'s representation had two `u32` segments, so the struct had an alignment of 4 bytes for a structure that was 8 bytes in size. Though the same size as a `u64` value, these structs were _under-aligned_ and as such, the compiler could not treat `Entity` as if it were a `u64` value. For reference, a `u64` value has a size and alignment of 8 bytes. Certain optimizations were being left out as the necessary assumptions could not be made at compile time regarding `Entity`. So `Entity`/`Identifier` were changed to have a manually defined layout and alignment, making it clearer to the compiler to treat these structs as if it were a `u64` value:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
#[repr(C, align(8))]
struct Identifier {
    #[cfg(target_endian = "little")]
    low: u32,
    high: NonZeroU32,
    #[cfg(target_endian = "big")]
    low: u32,
}
```

By defining the struct with a `repr(C)`, we could tell the compiler the layout of the struct exactly for both little endian and big endian platforms. By also defining the alignment of the struct to be 8 bytes, `Entity`/`Identifier` both appear to the compiler as if it were a `u64` value. The effect of this is that the `to_bits` method for `Entity`/`Identifier` becomes a simple `mov` operation which could be completely optimised away by the compiler with [LTO](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101458/2304/Optimize/Link-Time-Optimization--LTO-/What-is-Link-Time-Optimization--LTO-) and [inlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion).

Before:

```asm
to_bits:
    shl     rdi, 32
    mov     eax, esi
    or      rax, rdi
    ret
```

After:

```asm
to_bits:
    mov     rax, rdi
    ret
```

_But it doesn't stop there_. This had the effect of making hashing `Entity` even _faster_, yielding further gains on top of [#9903](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/9903) (which landed in 0.12). It turned out that the `PartialEq` implementation could be made even quicker, by comparing directly against the bits of one `Entity` with another. With manual implementations of `PartialOrd`/`Ord`, the codegen around `Entity` was improved considerably as the compiler was now being able to treat `Entity` as a pseudo-`u64` value.

For example, this was the codegen for `Entity > Entity` before the various changes:

```asm
greater_than:
    cmp     edi, edx
    jae     .LBB3_2
    xor     eax, eax
    ret

.LBB3_2:
    setne   dl
    cmp     esi, ecx
    seta    al
    or      al, dl
    ret
```

Afterwards, it compiles to this:

```asm
greater_than:
    cmp     rdi, rsi
    seta    al
    ret
```

But why didn't this land before? It turned out that imposing an alignment of 8 bytes on `Entity` made `Option<Entity>` increase in size from the original 12 bytes to 16 bytes. As such, some code paths _suffered_ performance regressions in needing to load and move around 16 byte values. But with niching now possible, the new representation could stay at 8 bytes in size even as an `Option`, preventing the regressions from occurring in the first place.

The micro-optimizations around `EntityHasher` did not end here though, as there was a PR made to "Save an instruction in `EntityHasher`" ([#10648](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10648) by @scottmcm). As [#10558](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10558) provided a significant improvement already to `EntityHasher` performance, the hashing algorithm was revised in a way that allowed LLVM to remove one further instruction in the compiled output. The compiler was already being clever enough to combine a multiply-shift-or operation into a single multiplication, but by expressing the algorithm with slight changes, an `or` instruction could be removed while retaining the desired hashing behaviour for `EntityHasher`.

![EntityHasher assemply output diff](entityhasher_output.png)

This had a detectable improvement in benchmarks, ranging from 3-6% improvement in lookups for `EntityHashMap`. These small optimizations may not amount to much on their own, but together they can provide meaningful improvements downstream.

![Benchmark results of optimisation work](entity_hash_optimsation_benches.png)

The above results show from where we started (`optimised_eq` being the first PR that introduced the benchmarks with the "Optimise Eq" feature) to where we are now with all the optimisations in place (`optimised_entity`). Improvements across the whole board, with clear performance benefits that should impact multiple areas of the codebase, not just when hashing entities.

### Porting `Query::for_each` to `QueryIter::fold` override

Currently to get the full performance out of iterating over queries, `Query::for_each` must be used in order to take advantage of auto-vectorization and internal iteration optimizations that the compiler can apply. However, this isn't idiomatic rust and is not an iterator method so you can't use it on an iterator chain. However, it is possible to get the same benefits for some iterator methods, for which [#6773](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/6773/) by @james7132 sought to achieve. By providing an override to `QueryIter::fold`, it was possible to port the iteration strategies of `Query::for_each` so that `Query::iter` and co could achieve the same gains. Not _every_ iterator method currently benefits from this, as they require overriding `QueryIter::try_fold`, but that is currently still a nightly-only optimisation. This same approach is within the Rust standard library.

This deduplicated code in a few areas, such as no longer requiring both `Query::for_each` and `Query::for_each_mut`, as one just needs to call `Query::iter` or `Query::iter_mut` instead. So code like:

```rust
fn some_system(mut q_transform: Query<&mut Transform, With<Npc>>) {
    q_transform.for_each_mut(|transform| {
        // Do something...
    });
}
```

Becomes:

```rust
fn some_system(mut q_transform: Query<&mut Transform, With<Npc>>) {
    q_transform.iter_mut().for_each(|transform| {
        // Do something...
    });
}
```

The assembly output was compared as well between what was on main branch versus the PR, with no tangible differences being seen between the old `Query::for_each` and the new `QueryIter::for_each()` output, validating the approach and ensuring the internal iteration optimizations were being applied.

As a plus, the same iternal iteration optimizations in `Query::par_for_each` now reuse code from `for_each`, deduplicating code there as well and enabling users to make use of `par_iter().for_each()`. As a whole, this means there's no longer any need for `Query::for_each`, `Query::for_each_mut`, `Query::_par_for_each`, `Query::par_for_each_mut` so these methods have been deprecated for 0.13 and will be removed in 0.14.

### Reducing `TableRow` `as` casting

Not all improvements were focused around performance. Some small changes were done to improve type safety and tidy-up some of the codebase to have less `as` casting being done on various call sites for `TableRow`. The problem with `as` casting is that in some cases, the cast will fail by truncating the value silently, which could then cause havoc by accessing the wrong row and so forth. [#10811](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10811) by @bushrat011899 was put forward to clean up the API around `TableRow`, providing convenience methods backed by `assert`s to ensure the casting operations could never fail, or if they did, they'd panic correctly.

Naturally, _adding_ asserts in potentially hot codepaths were cause for some concern, necessitating considerable benchmarking efforts to confirm there were regressions and to what level. With careful placing of the new `assert`s, the detected regression for these cases was in the region of 0.1%, well within noise.
But the benefit was a less error-prone API and more robust code.
With a complex unsafe codebase like `bevy_ecs`, every little bit helps.

## `WorldQuery` Trait Split

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @wainwrightmark @taizu-jin</div>

A [`Query`] has two type parameters: one for the the data to be fetched, and a second optional one for the filters.

In previous versions of Bevy both parameters simply required [`WorldQuery`]: there was nothing stopping you from using types intended as filters in the data position (or vice versa).

Apart from making the type signature of the [`Query`] items more complicated (see example below) this usually worked fine as most filters had the same behaviour in either position.

Unfortunately this was not the case for [`Changed`] and [`Added`] which had different (and undocumented) behaviour in the data position and this could lead to bugs in user code.

To allow us to prevent this type of bug at compile time, the [`WorldQuery`] trait has been replaced by two traits: [`QueryData`] and [`QueryFilter`]. The data parameter of a [`Query`] must now be [`QueryData`] and the filter parameter must be [`QueryFilter`].

Most user code should be unaffected or easy to migrate.

```rust
// Probably a subtle bug: `With` filter in the data position - will not compile in 0.13
fn my_system(query: Query<(Entity, With<ComponentA>)>)
{
    // The type signature of the query items is `(Entity, ())`, which is usable but unwieldy
  for (entity, _) in query.iter(){
  }
}

// Iidiomatic, compiles in both 0.12 and 0.13
fn my_system(query: Query<Entity, With<ComponentA>>)
{
  for entity in query.iter(){
  }
}
```

## Automatically insert `apply_deferred` systems

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @hymm</div>

When writing gameplay code, you might commonly have one system that wants to
immediately see the effects of commands queued in another system.
Before 0.13, you would have to manually insert an `apply_deferred` system between the two.
Bevy now detects when a system with commands
is ordered relative to other systems and inserts the `apply_deferred` for you.

```rust
// Before 0.13
app.add_systems(
    Update,
    (
        system_with_commands,
        apply_deferred,
        another_system,
    ).chain()
);
```

```rust
// After 0.13
app.add_systems(
    Update,
    (
        system_with_commands,
        another_system,
    ).chain()
);
```

This was a common beginner footgun: if two systems are ordered, shouldn't the second always see the results of the first?

Automatically inserted `apply_deferred` systems are optimized by automatically merging them if
possible. In most cases, it is recommended to remove all manually inserted
`apply_deferred` systems, as allowing Bevy to insert and merge these systems as needed will
usually be both faster and involve less boilerplate.

```rust
// This will only add one apply_deferred system.
app.add_systems(
    Update,
    (
        (system_1_with_commands, system_2).chain(),
        (system_3_with_commands, system_4).chain(),
    )
);
```

If this new behavior does not work for you, please consult the migration guide.
There are several new APIs that allow you to opt-out.

## One-Shot Systems Improvements

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @Nathan-Fenner</div>

In 0.12, we introduced [one-shot systems](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-12/#one-shot-systems), a handy way to call systems on demand without having to add them to a schedule.
The initial implementation had some limitations with regards to what systems could and could not be used as one-shot systems.
These limitations have since been resolved, starting with one-shot systems with input and output.

```rust

fn increment_sys(In(increment_by): In<i32>, mut counter: ResMut<Counter>) -> i32 {
    counter.0 += increment_by;
    counter.0
}

let mut world = World::new();
let id = world.register_system(increment_sys);

world.insert_resource(Counter(1));
let count_one = world.run_system_with_input(id, 5).unwrap(); // increment counter by 5 and return 6
let count_two = world.run_system_with_input(id, 2).unwrap(); // increment counter by 2 and return 8
```

Using either `world.run_system_with_input(system_id, input)` or `commands.run_system_with_input(system_id, input)`, you can now supply input parameters to systems that accept them. Additionally, both `world.run_system` and `world.run_system_with_input` now return system output as `Ok(output)`. Note that output cannot be returned when calling the system through commands, because of their deferred nature.

Some smaller improvements to one-shot systems include registering boxed systems with `register_boxed_system` (which was shipped in 0.12.1, but didn't get a blog post) and the ability to register exclusive systems as one-shot systems.

```rust
world.register_system(|world: &mut World| { /* do anything */ });
```

All these improvements round out one-shot systems significantly: they should now work just like any other Bevy system.

## WGPU Upgrade and Renderer Improvements

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @Elabajaba</div>

In Bevy 0.13 we upgraded from `wgpu` 0.17 to `wgpu` 0.19, which includes the long awaited `wgpu` [arcanization](https://gfx-rs.github.io/2023/11/24/arcanization.html) that allows us to do things like compiling shaders asynchronously to avoid shader compilation stutters, and to multithread draw call creation for better performance.

Due to changes in wgpu 0.19, we've added a new `webgpu` feature to Bevy that is now required when doing WebAssembly builds targeting WebGPU. Disabling the `webgl2` feature is no longer required when targeting WebGPU, but the new `webgpu` feature currently overrides the `webgl2` feature when enabled. Library authors, please do not enable the `webgpu` feature by default. In the future we plan on allowing you to target both WebGL2 and WebGPU in the same WebAssembly binary, but it requires reworking parts of the renderer where we're relying on compile time constants when targeting `webgl2`, and adding a way to choose the renderer's backend at runtime on web.

As usual, there's been some changes that may cause issues for custom shaders. We've swapped the material and mesh bind groups, so that mesh data is now in bind group 1, and material data is in bind group 2. This greatly improved our draw call batching when combined with changing the sorting functions for the opaque passes to sort by pipeline and mesh. Previously we were sorting them by distance from the camera. These batching improvements mean we're doing fewer draw calls, which improves CPU performance, especially in larger scenes. We've also removed the `get_instance_index` function in shaders, as it was only required to workaround an upstream bug that has been fixed in wgpu 0.19. For other shader or rendering changes, please see the [migration guide](/learn/migration-guides/0.12-0.13/) and [wgpu's changelog](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/v0.19/CHANGELOG.md).

## Dynamic Queries

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @james-j-obrien, @jakobhellermann, @Suficio</div>

In Bevy's ECS, queries use a type-powered DSL. The full type of the query (
what component to access, which filter to use) must be specified at compile time.

Sometimes, we can't easily know what data the query wants to access at compile time.
A UI with a dynamic list filtering by component, bindings for a scripting language,
_entity relationships_ (more on this later), all of those, are impossible to accomplish without
creating queries at runtime.

Dynamic queries lift this restriction.

The standard way of defining a `Query` is by using them as system parameters:

```rust
fn take_damage(mut player_health: Query<(Entity, &mut Health), With<Player>>) {
    // ...
}
```

**This won't change.** And for most (if not all)  gameplay use cases, you will
continue to happily use the delightfully simple [`Query`] API.

However, consider this situation: as a game or mod developer I want to list entities
with a specific component through a text prompt. Similarly to how the Quake console works.
What would that look like?

```rust
#[derive(Resource)]
struct UserQuery(String);

// user_query is entered as a text prompt by the user when the game is running.
// In a system, it's quickly apparent that we can't use `Query`.
fn list_entites_system(user_query: Res<UserQuery>, query: Query<FIXME, With<FIXME>>) {}

// Even when using the more advanced `World` API, we are stuck.
fn list_entities(user_query: String, world: &mut World) {
    // FIXME: what type goes here?
    let query = world.query::<FIXME>();
}
```

It's impossible to chose a type based on the value of `user_query`!
[`QueryBuilder`] solves this problem.

```rust
fn list_entities(
    user_query: String,
    type_registry: &TypeRegistry,
    world: &mut World,
) -> Option<()> {
    let name = user_query.split(' ').next()?;
    let type_id = type_registry.get_with_short_type_path(name)?.type_id();
    let component_id = world.components().get_id(type_id)?;

    let query = QueryBuilder::<FilteredEntityRef>::new(&mut world)
        .ref_id(component_id)
        .build();

    for entity_ref in query.iter(world) {
        let ptr = entity_ref.get_by_id(component_id);
        // Convert `ptr` into a `&dyn Reflect` and use it.
    }
    Some(())
}
```

It is still an error-prone, complex, and unsafe API, but it makes something that was previously
impossible possible.
We expect third party crates to provide convenient wrappers around the `QueryBuilder` API,
some of which will undoubtedly make their way upstream.

[`QueryBuilder`] is here for people who need queries with runtime access specification,
maybe you need to:

* Add a runtime filter to [`bevy-inspector-egui`]'s entity inspector.
* Define queries in a scripting language such as Lua or JavaScript.
* Define new components from a scripting language and query them.
* Add a [Quake-style console] to modify or query components from a prompt at runtime.
* Create an [editor with remote capabilities].
* And these are only the plans we've heard about so far!

### Relations

We mentioned _entity relationships_ earlier. What are relations? They are a way to associate
entities to other entities. For example, the `Parent` and `Children` components
in `bevy_hierarchy` are primitive relations.
By storing `Entity` inside of a component type, we can describe a link between entities.

`bevy_hierarchy` is fairly robust, but if you yourself want to create your own
relation (say, a group of units in an RTS game), the road ahead is a tar pit of footguns
and synchronization bugs.

_Entity relationships_ encode relations in the ECS. They are a staple of the [Flecs] C
ECS. This makes it _a pleasure_ to describe relations,
as opposed to the endless difficulties presented in most ECS's (including Bevy).

Sander Mertens, of Flecs fame, [describes in details] the prerequisites for an
entity relationship implementation.
One of those prerequisites is the ability to use entity ids as query parameters.
Dynamic queries allow just that.

### A long wait

Given how useful dynamic queries are, you might be wondering why Bevy didn't have them already.
But dynamic queries have a long history: they date back from **November 2022**,
when Suficio proposed [a simple change]. It was deemed too unsafe, [a counter-proposal]
was made by Jakob Hellermann. It was stalled due to complexity and the lack of qualified and
interested reviewers. They were finally merged in **January 2024**
thanks to [James O'Brien's stupendous effort][The dynamic query pull request].

For an in-depth technical and historical breakdown of dynamic queries, check

## Events Live Longer

Events are a useful tool for passing data into systems and between systems.

Internally, Bevy events are double-buffered, so a given event will be silently dropped once the buffers have swapped twice.
The `Events<T>` resource is setup this way so events are dropped after a predictable amount of time, preventing their queues from growing forever and causing a memory leak.

Before 0.12.1, event queues were swapped every update (i.e. every frame).
That was an issue for games with logic in `FixedUpdate`, since it meant events would normally disappear before systems in the next `FixedUpdate` could read them.

Bevy 0.12.1 changed the swap cadence to "every update that runs `FixedUpdate` one or more times" (only if the `TimePlugin` is installed).
This change did resolve the original problem, but it then caused problems in the other direction.
Users were surprised to learn some of their systems with `run_if` conditions would iterate much older events than expected.
(In hindsight, we should have considered it a breaking change and postponed it until this release.)
The change also introduced a bug (fixed in this release) where only one type of event was actually being dropped.

One proposed future solution to this lingering but unintended coupling between `Update` and `FixedUpdate` is to use event timestamps to change the default range of events visible by `EventReader<T>`.
That way systems in `Update` would skip any events older than a frame while systems in `FixedUpdate` could still see them.

For now, the `<=0.12.0` behavior can be recovered by simply removing the `EventUpdateSignal` resource.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins);
    
    /* ... */

    // If this resource is absent, events are dropped the same way as <=0.12.0.
    app.world.remove_resource::<EventUpdateSignal>();
    
    /* ... */

    app.run();
}
```

## Texture atlas rework

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @ManevilleF</div>

Texture atlases are a tool used to efficiently combine multiple images into a single larger atlas.

Bevy 0.13 significantly reworks them, reducing boilerplate and making the feature more data-oriented.
Say goodbye to `TextureAtlasSprite` and `UiTextureAtlasImage` components (and the corresponding `Bundle` types):
texture atlasing is now enabled by adding a single _additional_ component to your sprite and image entities: `TextureAtlas`.

### Why this change

Texture atlases (sometimes called sprite sheets) simply to draw a custom _section_ of the texture.
The new `TextureAtlas` represents that behaviour, storing:

* a `Handle<TextureAtlasLayout>`, an asset mapping an index to a `Rect` section of a texture
* a `usize` index defining which section `Rect` of the layout we want to display

## Texture Slicing and Tiling

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @ManevilleF</div>

In Bevy 0.13 we introduce a new 2D feature: CPU-based _slicing and tiling_ to both `bevy_sprite` and `bevy_ui` !

This feature is unlocked by a new optional component: `ImageScaleMode`

### 9 slicing

Adding `ImageScaleMode::Sliced(_)` to your 2D bundle enables [9 slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-slice_scaling),
keeping the image in proportions in resize, avoiding stretching of the texture.

![Stretched Vs Sliced texture](slice_vs_stretched.png)

This is very useful for UI, allowing your pretty textures to look right even as the size of your element changes.

![Sliced Buttons](ui_slice.png)
> Border texture by [Kenney's](https://kenney.nl/assets/fantasy-ui-borders)

Configuration:

```rust
commands.spawn((
    SpriteSheetBundle::default(),
    ImageScaleMode::Sliced(TextureSlicer {
        // The image borders are 20 pixels in every direction
        border: BorderRect::square(20.0),
        // we don't stretch the coners more than their actual size (20px)
        max_corner_scale: 1.0,
        ..default()
    }),
));
```

### Tiling

Adding `ImageMode::Tiled { .. }` to your 2D sprite entities enables _texture tiling_: repeating the image until their entire area is fulled.
This is commonly used for backgrounds.

<video controls><source src="logo_tiling.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video>

Configuration:

```rust
commands.spawn((
    SpriteSheetBundle::default(),
    ImageScaleMode::Tiled {
        // The image will repeat horizontally
        tile_x: true,
        // The image will repeat vertically
        tile_y: true,
        // The texture will repeat if the drawing rect is larger than the image size
        stretch_value: 1.0,
    },
));
```

## Lights work with `RenderLayers`

[`RenderLayers`] are Bevy's answer to quickly hiding and showing entities en masse, powered by camera-driven views.
Great for things like customizing the first-person view of what a character is holding (or making sure vampires don't show up in your mirrors!).

[`RenderLayers`] [now play nice] with lights, fixing a serious limitation to make sure this awesome feature can shine appropriately!

## Approximate Indirect Specular Occlusion

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @aevyrie</div>

Bevy's current PBR renderer over-brightens the image, especially at grazing angles where the fresnel
effect tends to make surfaces behave like mirrors. This over-brightening happens because the
surfaces must reflect _something_, but without path traced or screen-space reflections, the renderer
has to guess _what_ is being reflected. The best guess it can make is to sample the environment cube
map, even if light would've hit something else before reaching the environment light. This artifact,
where light occlusion is ignored, is called specular light leaking.

Consider a car tire; though the rubber might be shiny, you wouldn't expect it to have bright
specular highlights inside a wheel well, because the car itself is blocking (occluding) the light
that would otherwise cause these reflections. Checking for occlusion can be computationally
expensive. Instead, this change uses Bevy's existing screen space ambient occlusion to approximate
specular occlusion.

<b style="display:block; margin-bottom: -18px">Drag this image to compare</b>

<div class="image-compare" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9" data-title-a="Specular Occlusion On" data-title-b="Specular Occlusion Off">
  <img class="image-a" alt="Specular Occlusion On" src="specular_occlusion_on.jpg">
  <img class="image-b" alt="Specular Occlusion Off" src="specular_occlusion_off.jpg">

</div>

This could be further improved with screen space reflections (SSR). However, it is recommended to
use specular occlusion alongside SSR, because SSR still suffers from light leaking artifacts.

## Unload Render Assets From RAM

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @TODO</div>

TODO.

## Bind Group Layout Entries

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @IceSentry</div>

We added a new API, inspired by the bind group entries API from 0.12, to declare bind group layouts. This new API is based on using built-in functions to define bind group layouts resources and automatically set the index based on its position.

Here's a short example of how declaring a new layout looks:

```rust
let layout = render_device.create_bind_group_layout(
    "post_process_bind_group_layout"),
    &BindGroupLayoutEntries::sequential(
        ShaderStages::FRAGMENT,
        (
            texture_2d_f32(),
            sampler(SamplerBindingType::Filtering),
            uniform_buffer::<PostProcessingSettings>(false),
        ),
    ),
);
```

## Type-Safe Labels for the `RenderGraph`

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @DasLixou</div>

Bevy uses Rust's type system extensively when defining labels, letting developers lean on tooling to catch typos and ease refactors.
But this didn't apply to Bevy's render graph. In the render graph, hard-coded—and potentially overlapping—strings were used to define nodes and sub-graphs.

```rust
// Before 0.13
impl MyRenderNode {
    pub const NAME: &'static str = "my_render_node"
}
```

In Bevy 0.13, we're using a more robust way to name render nodes and render graphs with the help of Rust's type system and Bevy's label system.

```rust
// After 0.13
#[derive(Debug, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, RenderLabel)]
pub struct MyRenderLabel;
```

With those, the long paths for const-values also get shortened and cleaner which results into this

```rust
// Before 0.13
render_app
    .add_render_graph_node::<ViewNodeRunner<MyRenderNode>>(
        core_3d::graph::NAME,
        MyRenderNode::NAME,
    )
    .add_render_graph_edges(
        core_3d::graph::NAME,
        &[
            core_3d::graph::node::TONEMAPPING,
            MyRenderNode::NAME,
            core_3d::graph::node::END_MAIN_PASS_POST_PROCESSING,
        ],
    );

// After 0.13
use bevy::core_pipeline::core_3d::graph::{Labels3d, SubGraph3d};

render_app
    .add_render_graph_node::<ViewNodeRunner<MyRenderNode>>(
        SubGraph3d,
        MyRenderLabel,
    )
    .add_render_graph_edges(
        SubGraph3d,
        (
            Labels3d::Tonemapping,
            MyRenderLabel,
            Labels3d::EndMainPassPostProcessing,
        ),
    );
```

When you need dynamic labels for render nodes, those can still be achieved via e.g. tuple structs:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, RenderLabel)]
pub struct MyDynamicLabel(&'static str);
```

This is particularly nice because we don't have to store strings in here: we can use integers, custom enums or any other hashable type.

## Camera-Driven UI

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @bardt, @oceantume</div>

Historically, Bevy's UI elements have been scaled and positioned in the context of the primary window, regardless of the camera settings. This approach made some UI experiences like split-screen multiplayer difficult to implement, and others such as having UI in multiple windows impossible.

We are now introducing a more flexible way of rendering the user interface: camera-driven UI. Each camera can now have its own UI root, rendering according to its viewport, scale factor, and a target which can be a secondary window or even a texture.

This change unlocks a variety of new UI experiences, including split-screen multiplayer, UI in multiple windows, displaying non-interactive UI in a 3D world, and more.

![Split-screen with independent UI roots](split-screen.png)

If there is one camera in the world, you don't need to do anything; your UI will be displayed in that camera's viewport.

```rust
commands.spawn(Camera3dBundle {
    // Camera can have custom viewport, target, etc.
});
commands.spawn(NodeBundle {
    // UI will be rendered to the singular camera's viewport
});
```

For when more control is desirable, or there are multiple cameras, we introduce [`TargetCamera`] component. This component can be added to a root UI node to specify which camera it should be rendered to.

```rust
// For split-screen multiplayer, we set up 2 cameras and 2 UI roots
let left_camera = commands.spawn(Camera3dBundle {
    // Viewport is set to left half of the screen
}).id();

commands
    .spawn((
        TargetCamera(left_camera),
        NodeBundle {
            //...
        }
    ));

let right_camera = commands.spawn(Camera3dBundle {
    // Viewport is set to right half of the screen
}).id();

commands
    .spawn((
        TargetCamera(right_camera),
        NodeBundle {
            //...
        })
    );
```

With this change, we also remove [`UiCameraConfig`] component. If you were using it to hide UI nodes, you can achieve the same outcome by setting [`Visibility`] component on the root node.

```rust
commands.spawn(Camera3dBundle::default());
commands.spawn(NodeBundle {
    visibility: Visibility::Hidden, // UI will be hidden
    // ...
});
```

## Winit Upgrade

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @Thierry Berger, @mockersf</div>

Through the heroic efforts of our contributors and reviewers, Bevy is [now upgraded] to use `winit 0.29`.
[`winit`] is our windowing library: it abstracts over all of the different operating systems and input devices that end users might have,
and provides a basically uniform API to enable a write-once run-anywhere experience.
While this brings with it the usual litany of valuable [bug fixes and stability improvements],
the critical change revolves around how [`KeyCode`] is handled.

Previously, [`KeyCode`] represented the logical meaning of a key on a keyboard:
pressing the same button on the same keyboard when swapping between QWERTY and AZERTY keyboard layouts would give a different result!
Now,  [`KeyCode`] represents the physical location of the key.
Lovers of WASD games know that this is a much better default for games. For most Bevy developers, you can leave your existing code untouched
and simply benefit from better default keybindings for users on non-QWERTY keyboards or layouts.
If you need information about the logical keys pressed, use the [`ReceivedCharacter`] event.

## Animation Interpolation Methods

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @mockersf</div>

Generally, animations are defined by their **keyframes**: snapshots of the position (and other state) or objects at moments along a time line.
But what happens between those keyframes? Game engines need to **interpolate** between them, smoothly transitioning from one state to the next.

The simplest interpolation method is linear: the animated object just moves an equal distance towards the next keyframe every unit of time.
But this isn't always the desired effect! Both stop-motion-style and more carefully smoothed animations have their place.

Bevy now supports both step and cubic spline interpolation in animations.
Most of the time, this will just be parsed correctly from the glTF files, but when setting [`VariableCurve`] manually,
there's a new [`Interpolation`] field to set.

[`VariableCurve`]: https://dev-docs.bevyengine.org/bevy/animation/struct.VariableCurve.html
[`Interpolation`]: https://dev-docs.bevyengine.org/bevy/animation/enum.Interpolation.html

![Demonstrating the different types of interpolation](interpolation_methods.gif)]

## `Animatable` Trait

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @james7132</div>

When you think of "animation": you're probably imagining moving objects through space.
Translating them back and forth, rotating them, maybe even squashing and stretching them.
But in modern game development, animation is a powerful shared set of tools and concepts for "changing things over time".
Transforms are just the beginning: colors, particle effects, opacity and even boolean values like visibility can all be animated!

In Bevy 0.13, we've taken the first step towards [this vision](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/51-animation-composition.md),
with the [`Animatable`] trait.

```rust
/// An animatable value type.
pub trait Animatable: Reflect + Sized + Send + Sync + 'static {
    /// Interpolates between `a` and `b` with  a interpolation factor of `time`.
    ///
    /// The `time` parameter here may not be clamped to the range `[0.0, 1.0]`.
    fn interpolate(a: &Self, b: &Self, time: f32) -> Self;

    /// Blends one or more values together.
    ///
    /// Implementors should return a default value when no inputs are provided here.
    fn blend(inputs: impl Iterator<Item = BlendInput<Self>>) -> Self;

    /// Post-processes the value using resources in the [`World`].
    /// Most animatable types do not need to implement this.
    fn post_process(&mut self, _world: &World) {}
}

This is the first step towards animation blending and an asset-driven animation graph which is an essential for shipping large scale 3D games in Bevy.
But for now, this is just a building block. We've implemented this for a few key types (`Transform`, `f32` and `glam`'s `Vec` types) and published the trait.
Slot it into your games and crates, and team up with other contributors to help `bevy_animation` become just as pleasant and featureful as the rest of the engine.

## Multiple gizmo configurations

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @jeliag</div>

Gizmos let you quickly draw shapes using
an immediate mode API. Here is how you use them:

```rust
// bevy 0.12.1
fn set_gizmo_width(mut config: ResMut<GizmoConfig>) {
    // set the line width of every gizmos with this global configuration resource.
    config.line_width = 5.0;
}

fn draw_circles(mut gizmos: Gizmos) {
    // Draw two circles with a 5 pixels outline
    gizmos.circle_2d(vec2(100., 0.), 120., Color::NAVY);
    gizmos.circle_2d(vec2(-100., 0.), 120., Color::ORANGE);
}
```

Add a [`Gizmos`] system param and simply call a few methods. Cool!

Gizmos are also great for crate authors, they can use the same API.
For example, the [`oxidized_navigation`] navmesh library uses gizmos for its debug overlay.
Neat!

However, there is only one global configuration. Therefore,
a dependency could very well affect the game's gizmos.
It could even make them completely unusable.

Not so great. How to solve this? Gizmo groups.

Now, [`Gizmos`] comes with an optional parameter.
By default, it uses a global configuration:

```rust
fn draw_circles(mut default_gizmos: Gizmos) {
    default_gizmos.circle_2d(vec2(100., 0.), 120., Color::NAVY);
}
```

But with a [`GizmoConfigGroup`] parameter, `Gizmos` can choose a distinct configuration:

```rust
fn draw_circles(
    mut default_gizmos: Gizmos,
    // this uses a distinct configvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
    mut navigation_gizmos: Gizmos<NavigationGroup>,
) {
    // Two circles with different outline width
    default_gizmos.circle_2d(vec2(100., 0.), 120., Color::NAVY);
    navigation_gizmos.circle_2d(vec2(-100., 0.), 120., Color::ORANGE);
}
```

Create your own gizmo config group by deriving `GizmoConfigGroup`,
and registering it to the `App`:

```rust
#[derive(Default, Reflect, GizmoConfigGroup)]
pub struct NavigationGroup;

impl Plugin for NavigationPlugin {
    fn build(&mut self, app: &mut App) {
        app
            .init_gizmo_group::<NavigationGroup>()
            // ... rest of plugin initialization.
    }
}
```

And this is how you set the configuration of gizmo groups to different values:

```rust
// bevy 0.13.0
set_gizmo_width(mut config_store: ResMut<GizmoConfigStore>) {
    let config = config_store.config_mut::<DefaultGizmoConfigGroup>().0;
    config.line_width = 20.0;

    let navigation_config = config_store.config_mut::<NavigationGroup>().0;
    navigation_config.line_width = 10.0;
}
```

Now, the navigation gizmos have a fully separate configuration and don't conflict
with the game's gizmos.

Not only that, but the game dev can integrate and toggle the navigation gizmos with their
own debug tools however they wish. Be it a hotkey, a debug overlay UI button,
an RPC call. The world is your oyster.

## glTF Extensions

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @CorneliusCornbread</div>

**[glTF]** is a popular standardized open file format, used to store and share 3D models and scenes between different programs.
The trouble with standards though is that you eventually want to _customize_ it, just a little, to better meet your needs.
Khronos Group, in their wisdom, foresaw this and defined a standardized way to customize the format called **[extensions]**.

Extensions can be readily exported from other tools (like Blender), and contain [all sorts] of other useful information: from bleeding edge physically-based material information like anisotropy to performance hints like how to instance meshes.

Because Bevy parses loaded glTF's into our own entity-based hierarchy of objects, getting access to this information when you want to do new rendering things can be hard!
With [the changes by CorneliusCornbread] you can configure the loader to store a raw copy of the glTF file itself with your loaded asset, allowing you to parse and reprocess this information however you please.

## Extensionless Asset Support

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @bushrat011899</div>

In prior versions of Bevy, the default way to choose an [`AssetLoader`] for a particular asset was entirely based around file extensions. The recent addition of [`meta` files] allowed for specifying more granular loading behavior, but file extensions were still required. In Bevy 0.13, the asset type can now be used to infer the [`AssetLoader`].

```rust
// Uses AudioSettingsAssetLoader
let audio = asset_server.load("data/audio.json");

// Uses GraphicsSettingsAssetLoader
let graphics = asset_server.load("data/graphics.json");
```

This is possible because every [`AssetLoader`] is required to declare what **type** of asset it loads, not just the extensions it supports. Since the [`load`] method on [`AssetServer`] was already generic over the type of asset to return, this information is already available to the [`AssetServer`] so that the appropriate [`Handle`] type is returned.

```rust
// The above example with types shown
let audio: Handle<AudioSettings> = asset_server.load::<AudioSettings>("data/audio.json");
let graphics: Handle<GraphicsSettings> = asset_server.load::<GraphicsSettings>("data/graphics.json");
```

Now we can also use it to choose the [`AssetLoader`] itself.

```rust
#[derive(Resource)]
struct Settings {
    audio: Handle<AudioSettings>,
//                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                | This type...
}

fn setup(mut settings: ResMut<Settings>, asset_server: Res<AssetServer>) {
    settings.audio = asset_server.load("data/audio.json");
//                                ^^^^
//                                | ...is passed here...
}

impl AssetLoader for AudioSettingsAssetLoader {
    type Asset = AudioSettings;
//               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//               | ...and checked against AssetLoader::Asset

    /* snip */
}
```

When loading an asset, the loader is chosen by checking (in order):

1. The asset `meta` file
2. The type of `Handle<A>` to return
3. The file extension

```rust
// This will be inferred from context to be a glTF asset, ignoring the file extension
let gltf_handle = asset_server.load("models/cube/cube.gltf");

// This still relies on file extension due to the label
let cube_handle = asset_server.load("models/cube/cube.gltf#Mesh0/Primitive0");
//                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                                        | Asset path label
```

### File extensions are now optional

Since the asset type can be used to infer the loader, neither the file to be loaded nor the [`AssetLoader`] need to have file extensions.

```rust
pub trait AssetLoader: Send + Sync + 'static {
    /* snip */

    /// Returns a list of extensions supported by this [`AssetLoader`], without the preceding dot.
    fn extensions(&self) -> &[&str] {
        // A default implementation is now provided
        &[]
    }
}
```

Previously, an asset loader with no extensions was very cumbersome to use. Now, they can be used just as easily as any other loader. Likewise, if a file is missing its extension, Bevy can now choose the appropriate loader.

```rust
let license = asset_server.load::<Text>("LICENSE");
```

Appropriate file extensions are still recommended for good project management, but this is now a recommendation rather than a hard requirement.

### Multiple `AssetLoader`'s can be selected for the same asset

Now, a single path can be used by multiple asset handles as long as they are distinct asset types.

```rust
// Load the sound effect for playback
let bang = asset_server.load::<AudioSource>("sound/bang.ogg");

// Load the raw bytes of the same sound effect (e.g, to send over the network)
let bang_blob = asset_server.load::<Blob>("sound/bang.ogg");

// Returns the bang handle since it was already loaded
let bang_again = asset_server.load::<AudioSource>("sound/bang.ogg");
```

Note that the above example uses [turbofish] syntax for clarity. In practice, it's not required, since the type of asset loaded can usually be inferred by surrounding context at the call site.

```rust
#[derive(Resource)]
struct SoundEffects {
    bang: Handle<AudioSource>,
    bang_blog: Handle<Blob>,
}

fn setup(mut effects: ResMut<SoundEffects>, asset_server: Res<AssetServer>) {
    effects.bang = asset_server.load("sound/bang.ogg");
    effects.bang_blob = asset_server.load("sound/bang.ogg");
}
```

## Asset Transformers

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @thepackett, @RyanSparker</div>

Asset processing, at its core, involves implementing the `Process` trait, which takes some byte data representing an asset, transforming it, and then returning the processed byte data. However, implementing the `Process` trait by hand is somewhat involved, and so a generic `LoadAndSave<L: AssetLoader, S: AssetSaver>` `Process` implementation was written to make asset processing more ergonomic.

Using the `LoadAndSave` `Process` implementation, the previous Asset processing pipeline had four stages:

1. An `AssetReader` reads some asset source (filesystem, http, etc) and gets the byte data of an asset.
2. An `AssetLoader` reads the byte data and converts it to a bevy `Asset`.
3. An `AssetSaver` takes a bevy `Asset`, processes it, and then converts it back into byte data.
4. An `AssetWriter` then writes the asset byte data back to the asset source.

`AssetSaver`s were responsible for both transforming an asset and converting it into byte data. However, this posed a bit of an issue for code reusability. Every time you wanted to transform some asset, such as an image, you would need to rewrite the portion that converts the asset to byte data. To solve this, `AssetSaver`s are now solely responsible for converting an asset into byte data, and `AssetTransformer`s which are responsible for transforming an asset were introduced. A new `LoadTransformAndSave<L: AssetLoader, T: AssetTransformer, S: AssetSaver>` `Process` implementation was added to utilize the new `AssetTransformer`s.

The new asset processing pipeline, using the `LoadTransformAndSave` `Process` implementation, has five stages:

1. An `AssetReader` read some asset source (filesystem, http, etc) and gets the byte data of an asset.
2. An `AssetLoader` reads the byte data and converts it to a bevy `Asset`.
3. An `AssetTransformer` takes an asset and transforms it in some way.
4. An `AssetSaver` takes a bevy `Asset` and converts it back into byte data.
5. An `AssetWriter` then writes the asset byte data back to the asset source.

In addition to having better code reusability, this change encorages writing `AssetSaver`s for various common asset types, which could be used to add runtime asset saving functionality to the `AssetServer`.

The previous `LoadAndSave` `Process` implementation still exists, as there are some cases where an asset transformation step is unnecessary, such as when saving assets into a compressed format.

See the [Asset Processing Example](<https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/asset/processing/asset_processing.rs>) for a more detailed look into how to use `LoadTransformAndSave` to process a custom asset.

## <a name="what-s-next"></a>What's Next?

We have plenty of work in progress! Some of this will likely land in **Bevy 0.14**.

Check out the [**Bevy 0.14 Milestone**](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/milestone/20) for an up-to-date list of current work that contributors are focusing on for **Bevy 0.14**.

* **More editor experimentation:** Led by the brilliant JMS55, we've opened up a free-form [playground] to define and answer [key questions] about the design of the `bevy_editor`: not through discussion, but through concrete prototyping.
Should we use an in-process editor (less robust to game crashes) or an external one (more complex)?
Should we ship an editor binary (great for non-programmers) or embed it in the game itself (very hackable)?
Let's find out by doing!

There are some incredible mockups, functional prototypes and third-party editor-ajdacent projects out there. Some highlights:

* **bevy_ui improvements:** `bevy_ui` has its fair share of problems and limitations, [both mundane and architectural];
however, there are tangible things we can and are doing to improve this:
an improved scene format offers an end to the boilerplate when defining layouts, [rounded] [corners] just need a little love from reviewers, and the powerful and beloved object picking from [`bevy_mod_picking`] is slated to be upstreamed for both UI and gameplay alike.
A spectacular array of [third-party UI solutions] exists today, and learning from those and committing to a core architecture for UI logic and reactivity is a top priority.

* **A revised scene format:** [Scenes] are Bevy's general-purpose answer to serializing ECS data to disk: tracking entities, components, and resources for both save games and loading premade levels.
However, the existing .ron-based scene format is hard to hand-author, overly verbose, and brittle; changes to your code (or that of your dependencies!) rapidly invalidate saved scenes.
Cart has been cooking up a [revised scene format] with tight IDE and code integration that tackles these problems and makes authoring content (including UI!) in Bevy a joy. Whether you're writing code, writing scene files, or generating it from a GUI.

* **bevy_dev_tools:** The secret to smooth game development is great tooling; it's time to give Bevy developers the tools they need to inspect, debug and profile their games as part of the first-party experience.
From FPS meters to system stepping to a first-party equivalent of the fantastic [`bevy-inspector-egui`]: giving these a home in Bevy itself helps us polish them, points new users in the right direction, and allows us to use them in the `bevy_editor` itself.

* **The steady march towards relations:** [Entity-entity relations], the ability to track and manage connections between entities directly in the ECS, has been one of the most requested ECS features for years now.
Following the [trail blazed by `flecs`], the mad scientists over in `#ecs-dev` are steadily [reshaping our internals], [experimenting with external implementations], and shipping the general purpose building blocks (like dynamic queries or [lifecycle hooks] needed to build a fast, robust and ergonomic solution.

* **Meshlet rendering** Split meshes into clusters of triangles called meshlets, which bring many efficiency gains. During the 0.13 development cycle we made a [lot of progress on this feature](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10164). We implemented a GPU-driven meshlet renderer that can scale to much more triangle-dense scenes, with much lower CPU load. Memory usage, however, is very high, and we haven't implemented LODs or compression yet. Instead of releasing it half-baked, we're going to continue to iterate, and are very excited to (hopefully) bring you this feature in a future release.
