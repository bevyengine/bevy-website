Thanks to **TODO** contributors, **TODO** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous sponsors**](/community/donate), we're happy to announce the **Bevy 0.13** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/book/getting-started/) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.

To update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to **Bevy 0.13**, check out our [0.12 to 0.13 Migration Guide](/learn/migration-guides/0.12-0.13/).

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

* **First-party primitive shapes:** basic shapes are a core building block of both game engines and video games: we've added a polished collection of them for you to use!
* **Dynamic queries:** refining queries from within systems is extremely expressive, and is the last big puzzle piece for runtime-defined types and third-party modding and scripting integration.
* **Automatically inferred command flush points:** tired of reasoning about where to put `apply_deferred` and confused about why your commands weren't being applied? Us too! Now, Bevy's scheduler uses ordinary `.before` and `.after` constraints and inspects the system parameters to automatically infer (and deduplicate) synchronization points.
* **Slicing, tiling and ninepatch sprites and UI:** ninepatch layout is a popular tool for smoothly scaling stylized tilesets and UIs. Now in Bevy!
* **Lightmaps:** the first step towards baked global illumination: a fast, popular and pretty lighting technique.
* **Animation interpolation modes:** Bevy now supports non-linear interpolation modes in exported glTF animations.

## Multiple gizmo configurations

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @jeliag</div>

Since [the 0.11 release], Bevy supports gizmos. Gizmos allow drawing shapes using
an immediate mode API. Here is how you use them:

```rust
// bevy 0.12.1
fn set_gizmo_width(mut config: ResMut<GizmoConfig>) {
    // set the line width of every gizmos with this global configuration resource.
    config.line_width = 5.0;
}

fn draw_circles(mut gizmos: Gizmos) {
    // Draw two circles with a 5 pixels outline
    gizmos.circle_2d(vec2(100., 0.), 120., Color::NAVY);
    gizmos.circle_2d(vec2(-100., 0.), 120., Color::ORANGE);
}
```

Add a [`Gizmos`] system param and call a few methods, nothing more. Cool!

Gizmos are also great for crate authors, they can use the same API.
For example, the [`oxidized_navigation`] navmesh library uses gizmos for its debug overlay.
Great!

This is why gizmos were quickly adopted by the community.

But after quick adoption, the community quickly found their limitations.

Remember: crate authors, as well as game devs, can use gizmos and set their config globally.
However, there is only one global configuration. Therefore,
a dependency could very well affect the game's gizmos.
It could even make them completely unusable.

Not so great.

How to solve this? Gizmo groups.

Now, [`Gizmos`] comes with an optional parameter.
By default, it uses a global configuration:

```rust
fn draw_circles(mut default_gizmos: Gizmos) {
    default_gizmos.circle_2d(vec2(100., 0.), 120., Color::NAVY);
}
```

But with a [`GizmoConfigGroup`] parameter, `Gizmos` can choose a distinct configuration:

```rust
fn draw_circles(
    mut default_gizmos: Gizmos,
    // this uses a distinct configvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
    mut navigation_gizmos: Gizmos<NavigationGroup>,
) {
    // Two circles with different outline width
    default_gizmos.circle_2d(vec2(100., 0.), 120., Color::NAVY);
    navigation_gizmos.circle_2d(vec2(-100., 0.), 120., Color::ORANGE);
}
```

Create your own gizmo config group by deriving `GizmoConfigGroup`,
and registering it to the `App`:

```rust
#[derive(Default, Reflect, GizmoConfigGroup)]
pub struct NavigationGroup;

impl Plugin for NavigationPlugin {
    fn build(&mut self, app: &mut App) {
        app
            .init_gizmo_group::<NavigationGroup>()
            // ... rest of plugin initialization.
    }
}
```

And this is how you set the configuration of gizmo groups to different values:

```rust
// bevy 0.13.0
set_gizmo_width(mut config_store: ResMut<GizmoConfigStore>) {
    let config = config_store.config_mut::<DefaultGizmoConfigGroup>().0;
    config.line_width = 20.0;

    let navigation_config = config_store.config_mut::<NavigationGroup>().0;
    navigation_config.line_width = 10.0;
}
```

Now, the navigation gizmos have a fully separate configuration and don't conflict
with the game's gizmos.

Not only that, but the game dev can integrate the navigation gizmos with their
own debug tools however they wish. Be it a hotkey, a debug overlay UI button,
an RPC call. The world is your oyster.
