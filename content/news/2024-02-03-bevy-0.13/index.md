Thanks to **TODO** contributors, **TODO** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous sponsors**](/community/donate), we're happy to announce the **Bevy 0.13** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/book/getting-started/) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.
And to see what the engine has to offer hands-on, check out the entries in the [latest Bevy Jam](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-4/entries), including the winner [That's a lot of beeeeees](https://andrewb330.itch.io/thats-a-lot-of-beeeeees)

To update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to **Bevy 0.13**, check out our [0.12 to 0.13 Migration Guide](/learn/migration-guides/0.12-0.13/).

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

<!-- more -->

* **First-party primitive shapes:** basic shapes are a core building block of both game engines and video games: we've added a polished collection of them for you to use!
* **System stepping:** completely pause and advance through your game frame-by-frame or system-by-system to interactively debug game logic, all while rendering continues to update.
* **Dynamic queries:** refining queries from within systems is extremely expressive, and is the last big puzzle piece for runtime-defined types and third-party modding and scripting integration.
* **Automatically inferred command flush points:** tired of reasoning about where to put `apply_deferred` and confused about why your commands weren't being applied? Us too! Now, Bevy's scheduler uses ordinary `.before` and `.after` constraints and inspects the system parameters to automatically infer (and deduplicate) synchronization points.
* **Slicing, tiling and nine-patch sprites:** ninepatch layout is a popular tool for smoothly scaling stylized tilesets and UIs. Now in Bevy!
* **Lightmaps:** the first step towards baked global illumination: a fast, popular and pretty lighting technique.
* **Animation interpolation modes:** Bevy now supports non-linear interpolation modes in exported glTF animations.
