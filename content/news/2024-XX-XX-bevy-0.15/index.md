Thanks to **TODO** contributors, **TODO** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous donors**](/donate), we're happy to announce the **Bevy 0.15** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/quick-start) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.

To update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to **Bevy 0.15**, check out our [0.14 to 0.15 Migration Guide](/learn/migration-guides/0-14-to-0-15/).

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

- TODO

As is now tradition, Bevy 0.15 was prepared using a **release candidate** process to help ensure that you can upgrade right away with peace of mind.
We've worked closely with both plugin authors and ordinary users to catch critical bugs, round the rough corners off our new features, and refine the migration guide.
As we prepared fixes, we've [shipped new release candidates on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy/versions?sort=date), letting core ecosystem crates update and listening closely for show-stopping problems.
Thank you so much to [everyone who helped out](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1295069829740499015): these efforts are a vital step towards making Bevy something that teams large and small can trust to work reliably.

## What's Next?

The features above may be great, but what else does Bevy have in flight?
Peering deep into the mists of time (predictions are _extra_ hard when your team is almost all volunteers!), we can see some exciting work taking shape:
