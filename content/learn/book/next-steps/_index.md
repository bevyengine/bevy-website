You have reached the end of The Bevy Book! And unfortunately, we haven't even scratched the surface of Bevy's features! Eventually this book will cover almost every facet of Bevy, but until then we recommend checking out:

* **[The Bevy Examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#examples)**: We create an example for every major Bevy feature. This is currently the best way to learn Bevy's features and how to use them.
* **[Breakout](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/latest/examples/game/breakout.rs)**: A small "breakout" clone that illustrates what a real Bevy game looks like.
* **[Bevy API Docs](https://docs.rs/bevy)**: Bevy's Rust API documentation.
* **[Awesome Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/awesome-bevy)**: List of projects by the Bevy community, including:
  * **[Learning Resources](https://github.com/bevyengine/awesome-bevy#learning)**: Tutorials, documentation, and examples.
  * **[Plugins](https://github.com/bevyengine/awesome-bevy#plugins-and-crates)**: Extra functionality you can use in your projects.
  * **[Games](https://github.com/bevyengine/awesome-bevy#games)**: Open-source games in various stages of development.
