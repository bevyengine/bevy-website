To display stuff on screen, 3D rendering... (what about 2D?)

list of crates (pbr, core pipeline, mesh, light, anti_aliasing, etc)

Quick start example spawn mesh/camera/etc:
```rust

```

wgpu/supported platforms (webgpu, native, mobile, webgl2)

naga/wgsl/wesl

Where to stick?:
    * Decals (forward, clustered) (stick with meshes?)
    * OIT
    * RenderLayers
    * Particles (not upstreamed in bevy yet)
    * Useful shader math stuff
