## How to read this guide

While this guide is not designed to be read in sequence, it is still recommmended to do so. This book gives a surface level overview first with very simple examples and then explores Rust's type system magic. Astute readers may skip to more interesting chapters.

It is recommended to read atleast the ECS chapter.
