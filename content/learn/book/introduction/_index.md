## How to read this guide

While this guide is not designed to be read in sequence, it is still recommended to do so. This book gives a surface level overview first with very simple examples and then explores Rust's type system magic. Astute readers may skip to more interesting chapters.

It is recommended to read at least the ECS chapter.
