Installing Bevy is very simple.

### Prerequisites
Cargo-latest
A text editor
A terminal (for running cargo commands)

### Instructions

The following guide will walk you through setting up a local Bevy project.

#### Install Rust

A good step to install Rust is to follow the following [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](instructions).

#### Create a new project

```
$ cargo new bevy-test
```
```
$ cd bevy-test/
```
```
$ cargo add bevy
```

#### Running your project locally

This is as simple as running 
```
$ cargo run
```
but we will see in later steps how to create a very simple and minimal Bevy App.
