This section will get you started in creating a breakout clone with bevy. You can find the completed code in the examples folder [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/master/examples/game).

This section assumes you:

* Have read through the [getting started](/learn/book/getting-started) section and completed the setup process.
* Are running the latest stable rust and latest version of bevy (![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bevy.svg)).
