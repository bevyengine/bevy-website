Your entire game is stored inside a Bevy [`App`], which is responsible for running the main game loop and storing the main [`World`].
The [`World`] stores all of the App's state &mdash; [Entities], [Components], [Resources], and [Systems].

## Apps

{% todo() %}

* explain what the app does
* example `main()` function

{% end %}

## Worlds

{% todo() %}

* explain what the world does
* vaguely explain how the world actually stores entities and components? maybe too early for that

{% end %}
