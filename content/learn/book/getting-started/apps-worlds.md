Your entire game is stored inside a Bevy [`App`], which is responsible for running the main game loop and storing the main [`World`].
The [`World`] stores all of the App's state &mdash; [Entities], [Components], [Resources], and [Systems].

[`App`]: https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/app/struct.App.html
[Entities]: /learn/book/ecs/entities-components/
[Components]: /learn/book/ecs/entities-components/#working-with-components
[Resources]: /learn/book/ecs/resources/
[Systems]: /learn/book/ecs/systems-queries/
[`World`]: https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/world/struct.World.html

## Apps

{% todo() %}

* explain what the app does
* example `main()` function

{% end %}

## Worlds

{% todo() %}

* explain what the world does
* vaguely explain how the world actually stores entities and components? maybe too early for that

{% end %}
