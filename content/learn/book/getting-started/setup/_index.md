I know you are itching to start making games, but we need to do a _small_ amount of setup first.

## Rust Setup

All Bevy app and engine code is written in Rust. This means that before we begin, we need to set up our Rust development environment.

### Installing Rust

Install Rust by following the [Rust Getting Started Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

Once this is done, you should have the ```rustc``` compiler and the ```cargo``` build system installed in your path.

### Install OS dependencies
* [Linux](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md)
* Windows: Make sure to install [VS2019 build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16)
* MacOS: No dependencies here

### Code Editor / IDE

You can use any code editor you want, but we highly recommend one that has a [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) plugin. It's still in development, but it already provides top-tier autocomplete and code intelligence. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has an officially supported [rust-analyzer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).

### Rust Learning Resources

The goal of this book is to learn Bevy, so it won't serve as a full Rust education. If you would like to learn more about the Rust language, check out the following resources:

* [**The Rust Book**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): the best place to learn Rust from scratch
* [**Rust by Example**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/): learn Rust by working through live coding examples


## Create a new Bevy Project

Now we are ready to set up a Bevy project! Bevy is just a normal Rust dependency. You can either add it to an existing Rust project or create a new one. For completeness we will assume you are starting from scratch.

### Create a new Rust executable project

First, navigate to a folder where you want to create your new project. Then, run the following command to create a new folder containing our rust executable project:

```sh
cargo new my_bevy_game
cd my_bevy_game
```

Now run ```cargo run``` to build and run your project. You should see ```Hello, world!``` printed to your terminal. Open the ```my_bevy_game``` folder in your code editor of choice and take some time to look through the files.

```main.rs``` is the entry point of your program:
```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

```Cargo.toml``` is your "project file". It contains metadata about your project such as its name, dependencies, and build configuration.

```toml
[package]
name = "my_bevy_game"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
```

### Add Bevy to your project's Cargo.toml

Bevy is [available as a library on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy), the official Rust package repository. Find the latest version number ([![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bevy.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)) and add it to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[package]
name = "my_bevy_game"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021" # this needs to be 2021, or you need to set "resolver=2"

[dependencies]
bevy = "0.7" # make sure this is the latest version
```

### Cargo Workspaces

If you are using [Cargo Workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html), you will also need to add the resolver to your Cargo.toml file in the root directory:

```toml
[workspace]
resolver = "2" # Important! wgpu/Bevy needs this!
```

### Enable Fast Compiles (Optional)

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for maximally fast iterative compiles, we recommend the following configuration:

* **Enable Bevy's Dynamic Linking Feature**: This is the most impactful compilation time decrease! If `bevy` is a dependency you can compile the binary with the "dynamic" feature flag (enables dynamic linking). Note that right now, this doesn't work on Windows.
    ```sh
    cargo run --features bevy/dynamic
    ```
    If you don't want to add the `--features bevy/dynamic` to each run, this flag can permanently be set via `Cargo.toml`:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    bevy = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["dynamic"] }
    ```
    NOTE: Remember to revert this before releasing your game! Otherwise you will need to include `libbevy_dylib` alongside your game if you want it to run. If you remove the "dynamic" feature, your game executable can run standalone.

* **LLD linker**: The Rust compiler spends a lot of time in the "link" step. LLD is _much faster_ at linking than the default Rust linker. To install LLD, find your OS below and run the given command:
    * **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install lld`
    * **Arch**: `sudo pacman -S lld`
    * **Windows**: Ensure you have the latest [cargo-binutils](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cargo-binutils)
        ```sh
        cargo install -f cargo-binutils
        rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
        ```
    * **MacOS**: Modern LLD does not yet support MacOS, but we can use zld instead: `brew install michaeleisel/zld/zld`
* **Nightly Rust Compiler**: This gives access to the latest performance improvements and "unstable" optimizations
    
    Create a ```rust-toolchain.toml``` file in the root of your project, next to ```Cargo.toml```.
    ```toml
    [toolchain]
    channel = "nightly"
    ```
    For more information, see [The rustup book: Overrides](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file).
* **Generic Sharing**: Allows crates to share monomorphized generic code instead of duplicating it. In some cases this allows us to "precompile" generic code so it doesn't affect iterative compiles. This is only available on nightly Rust.

To enable fast compiles, install the nightly rust compiler and LLD. Then copy the contents of [this file](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/.cargo/config_fast_builds) to `YOUR_WORKSPACE/.cargo/config.toml`. For the project in this guide, that would be `my_bevy_game/.cargo/config.toml`.

If something went wrong, check out our [troubleshooting section](/learn/book/troubleshooting/) or [ask for help on our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gMUk5Ph).

### Build Bevy

Now run ```cargo run``` again. The Bevy dependencies should start building. This will take some time as you are essentially building an engine from scratch. You will only need to do a full rebuild once. Every build after this one will be fast!

Now that we have our Bevy project set up, we're ready to start making our first Bevy app!
