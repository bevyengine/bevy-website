Like any game engine, Bevy is a large project, and there's a lot to learn!
Everyone learns differently, so we offer a variety of complementary learning paths:

* [Quickstart](learn/quickstart): Dive in and get your hands dirty, learning how to create a simple game in a hands-on tutorial for absolute beginners.
* [The Book](learn/book): Read about the core concepts that make Bevy work, and browse our library of the advanced topics needed to ship a production game.
* [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/): Versioned API documentation that explains exactly what every struct, method and function mean. Module and crate docs are also great, and provide an overview of the structure and usage of specific areas of the code.
* [API examples](https://bevyengine.org/examples/api): Try out our APIs hands on, as part of larger runnable examples.
* [Usage examples](https://bevyengine.org/examples/usage): Figure out how to solve specific game dev problems (like running a game in split screen) by shamelessly stealing from our runnable snippets.
* [Game examples](https://bevyengine.org/examples/game): Get a sense of how to structure larger projects and tackle new genres with playable game stubs.

## Reading this book

This book is [explanatory documentation](https://diataxis.fr/): you can read it cover to cover, or simply skip ahead to the sections that are most interesting to you.

If you are new to Bevy, read the first chapter.
It will give you a quick summary of the most important concepts and terms needed to understand the rest of this book.

Once you're done that, feel free to jump around to any chapter you please, using the sidebar as an index.
We've attempted to arrange them in the order that you might encounter them
but they do not assume you have read previous chapters.

## Corrections and extensions

Like any good piece of documentation, the Bevy Book is a living, breathing, piece of documentation.
If you spot a typo, [submit a quick PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/pulls).
If you'd like to refactor something or add a new section, read our [Contributing Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/contribute/introduction/) and we'd be happy to welcome you to the flock!
