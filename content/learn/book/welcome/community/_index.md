Our community is very active and welcoming.

## Third-Party Crates

Bevy has a lot of third-party crates associated with it, such as [bevy_retrograde](https://github.com/katharostech/bevy_retrograde), [bevy_spicy_networking](https://github.com/CabbitStudios/bevy_spicy_networking) and [heron](https://github.com/jcornaz/heron).

These are often published to [crates.io](https://crates.io) and use Bevy's plugin system, meaning technically, at this point, you can make your own thrid-party crates (although, they may not be entirely useful).

There is a whole GitHub repository dedicated to showing awesome bevy assets, aptly named [bevy-assets](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-assets). Be sure to check it out!

## Contributing

[Cart](https://github.com/cart) has clearly put a lot of hard work into making an awesome engine. So why not lend him a helping hand? Whether it be the engine itself, learning resources (like this book) or even moderation on various forums, it's easy to help make Bevy the best engine it can possibly be.

You can check out the rules on contribution [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Lastly, if you want to help make this [cart](https://github.com/cart)'s full time job, you can donate money to him [here](https://github.com/sponsors/cart).
