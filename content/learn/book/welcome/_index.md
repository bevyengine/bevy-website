Hi! Thanks for choosing the Bevy Game Engine! Our community is glad to have you!

Within a few minutes, you will be making some games and learning more of what this amazing engine has to offer, but before we dive into that, we need an introduction.

## What Bevy is (and what it is not)

The Bevy Game Engine is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust that is completely [open-source](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy). It is capable of 2D and 3D games, uses an Entity Component System and allows for easy enhancement and customization.

It is constantly being updated and worked on by its creator, [cart](https://github.com/cart) and the engine's increasing commmunity. **Due to this the engine is not currenty production-ready and should NOT be used for time-sensitive projects**

In quicker terms, Bevy is:
- A easy-to-use game-making tool
- Capable of 2D and 3D
- Data-Driven
- Easily extendable

And isn't:
- A fully-featured product
- Intended for use with big teams of people with jobs on the line
- Stable

## General Recommendations

While this book will provide context for some Rust capabilities, it does NOT include a lot of the best practices that the language and this may inhibit your learning. 

We highly recommend reading some form of Rust documentation. The best resource to choose is probably [The Rust Book](https://docs.rust-lang.org/book), as it provides projects and examples.

However, if you like to get your hands dirty quick, you can try [Rust by Example](https://docs.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example) or [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/).

**In short, this book should not be used as a learning resource for the Rust Programming Language.**
