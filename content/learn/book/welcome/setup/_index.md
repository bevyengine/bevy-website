I know you are itching to start making games, but we need to do a _small_ amount of setup first.

## Rust Setup

All Bevy app and engine code is written in Rust. This means that before we begin, we need to set up our Rust development environment.

### Install Rust

Install Rust by following the [Rust Getting Started Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

Once this is done, you should have the `rustc` compiler and the `cargo` build system installed in your path.

### Install OS dependencies

* [Linux](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md)
* Windows: Make sure to install [VS2019 build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16)
* MacOS: No dependencies here!

### Code Editor / IDE

You can use any code editor you want, but we highly recommend one that has a [Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer) plugin. Rust Analyzer is still in development, but it already provides top-tier autocomplete and code intelligence. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has an officially supported [Rust Analyzer Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer).

### Rust Learning Resources

In our experience, Bevy can be an engaging and rewarding way to learn Rust.
Writing games is a lot of fun, and can help motivate you to try out new language features.

That said, this book is targeted towards users who already have a decent grasp on Rust.
If you would like to learn more about the Rust language, check out the following resources:

* [**The Rust Book**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): the best place to learn Rust from scratch
* [**Rust by Example**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/): learn Rust by working through live coding examples
* [**Rustlings**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings): learn Rust through a series of fun, interactive exercises

## Bevy Setup

Now we are ready to set up a Bevy project! Bevy is just a normal Rust dependency. You can either add it to an existing Rust project or create a new one. For completeness we will assume you are starting from scratch.

### Create a new Rust project

First, navigate to a folder where you want to create your new project. Then, run the following command to create (and then navigate to) a new folder containing our rust executable project:

```sh
cargo new my_bevy_game
cd my_bevy_game
```

If you already have a folder that you'd like to use, use `cargo init` from within that folder instead.

Now run `cargo run` to build and run your project. You should see `Hello, world!` printed to your terminal. Open the `my_bevy_game` folder in your code editor of choice and take some time to look through the files.

`main.rs` is the entry point of your program:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

`Cargo.toml` is your "project file". It contains metadata about your project such as its name, dependencies, and build configuration.

```toml
[package]
name = "my_bevy_game"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["You <you@veryrealemail.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
```

### Add Bevy to your project's Cargo.toml

Bevy is [available as a library on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy), the official Rust package repository. Find the latest version number ([![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bevy.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)) and add it to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[package]
name = "my_bevy_game"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["You <you@veryrealemail.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
bevy = "0.5" # make sure this is the latest version
```

### Build Bevy

Now run `cargo run` again. The Bevy dependencies should start building. This will take some time as you are essentially building an engine from scratch. You will only need to do a full rebuild once. Every build after this one will be fast!

Now that we have our Bevy project set up, we're ready to start making our first Bevy app!

### Checking that it works

Within `main.rs`, let's create our first app and check that all the dependencies are working correctly!

```rust,no_run
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
  App::new().add_plugins(DefaultPlugins).run();
}
```

Use `cargo run` to test it out.
This will just show an empty window, and includes all of the standard functionality needed to make Bevy games.

### Performance by default

Rust's compiler supports several levels of performance optimization, with fairly dramatic effects on Bevy's performance.
For a more pleasant and realistic development experience, we recommend enabling optimized compilation by default by adding the following lines to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 3
```

### Faster compiling

* **Bevy's Dynamic Linking Feature**: This is the most impactful iterative compilation time decrease! It requires no special setup except on Windows, where you also have to follow the three numbered steps below for it to work. If `bevy` is a dependency you can compile the binary with the `dynamic` feature flag (enables dynamic linking):

  ```sh
  cargo run --features bevy/dynamic
  ```

  If you don't want to add the `--features bevy/dynamic` to each run, this flag can permanently be set via `Cargo.toml`:

  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  bevy = { version = "0.5.0", features = ["dynamic"] }
  ```

  NOTE: Remember to revert this before releasing your game! Otherwise you will need to include `libbevy_dylib` alongside your game if you want it to run. If you remove the `dynamic` feature, your game executable can run standalone.

For the fastest iterative compile times, we recommend the following configuration as well. You need to follow all three steps for any effect:

1. **LLD linker**: The Rust compiler spends a lot of time in the "link" step. LLD is _much faster_ at linking than the default Rust linker. To install LLD, find your OS below and run the given command:
   * **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install lld clang`
   * **Arch**: `sudo pacman -S lld`
   * **Windows**: Ensure you have the latest [cargo-binutils](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cargo-binutils)

      ```sh
      cargo install -f cargo-binutils
      rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
      ```

   * **MacOS**: Modern LLD does not yet support MacOS, but we can use zld instead: `brew install michaeleisel/zld/zld`
2. **Nightly Rust Compiler**: This gives access to the latest performance improvements and "unstable" optimizations

   ```sh
   # Install the nightly toolchain
   rustup toolchain install nightly
   # EITHER configure your current project to use nightly (run this command within the project)
   rustup override set nightly
   # OR configure cargo to use nightly for all projects -- switch back with `rustup default stable`
   rustup default nightly
   ```

   You can use `cargo +nightly ...` if you don't want to change the default to nightly, but just want to use it once for the current command.

3. **Configure cargo**: With the linker installed and nightly rust activated, all we need to do now is put them to proper use. Copy [this file](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/.cargo/config_fast_builds) to `YOUR_WORKSPACE/.cargo/config.toml`. For the project in this guide, that would be `my_bevy_game/.cargo/config.toml`.

   Beyond enabling the LLD linker, this configuration file also activates **Generic Sharing** (unless you use Windows), which allows crates to share monomorphized generic code instead of duplicating it. In some cases this allows us to "precompile" generic code so it doesn't affect iterative compiles. This is only available on nightly Rust.

4. **Hot reloading**: Sometimes, the fastest compilation is no compilation.
For instant, compile-free simple changes, the excellent community-run [`bevy-inspector-egui`](https://crates.io/crates/bevy-inspector-egui) crate allows you to visually edit the values of your structs, and see the effect on your game in real time.

## Troubleshooting

Having trouble getting Bevy running?
Take a look at these known problems and how to solve them.

### Unable to find a GPU

```txt
thread 'main' panicked at 'Unable to find a GPU! Make sure you have installed required drivers!'
```

This error message means that bevy is unable to draw to your screen.
Causes include:

1. Vulkan-compatible drivers not installed. To fix this, install/update the drivers. On Linux this may be `vulkan-intel` or `vulkan-radeon`.
2. Trying to run an example on a headless machine. To fix this, install a GPU!

### Use of unstable features

Bevy's minimum Rust version is "latest stable".
If your compiler is complaining that `bevy` is using unstable features, update your rust version using `rustup update`.
