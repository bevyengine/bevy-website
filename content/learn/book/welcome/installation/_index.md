I know you are itching to start making games, but we need to do a _small_ amount of setup first.

## Rust Setup

All Bevy app and engine code is written in Rust. This means that before we begin, we need to set up our Rust development environment.

### Install Rust

Install Rust by following the [Rust Getting Started Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

Once this is done, you should have the ```rustc``` compiler and the ```cargo``` build system installed in your path.

### Install OS dependencies

* [Linux](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md)
* Windows: If you use the `msvc` toolchain make sure to install [VS2019 build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16)
* MacOS: No dependencies here

### Code Editor / IDE

You can use any code editor you want, but we highly recommend one that has a [Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer) plugin. Rust Analyzer is still in development, but it already provides top-tier autocomplete and code intelligence. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has an officially supported [Rust Analyzer Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer).

### Rust Learning Resources

In our experience, Bevy can be an engaging and rewarding way to learn Rust.
Writing games is a lot of fun, and can help motivate you to try out new language features.

That said, this book is targeted towards users who already have a decent grasp on Rust.
If you would like to learn more about the Rust language, check out the following resources:

* [**The Rust Book**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): the best place to learn Rust from scratch
* [**Rust by Example**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/): learn Rust by working through live coding examples
* [**Rustlings**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings): learn Rust through a series of fun, interactive exercises

## Bevy Setup

Now we are ready to set up a Bevy project! Bevy is just a normal Rust dependency. You can either add it to an existing Rust project or create a new one. For completeness we will assume you are starting from scratch.

### Create a new Rust project

First, navigate to a folder where you want to create your new project. Then, run the following command to create a new folder containing our rust executable project:

```sh
cargo new my_bevy_game
cd my_bevy_game
```

Now run `cargo run` to build and run your project. You should see `Hello, world!` printed to your terminal. Open the `my_bevy_game` folder in your code editor of choice and take some time to look through the files.

`main.rs` is the entry point of your program:

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

`Cargo.toml` is your "project file". It contains metadata about your project such as its name, dependencies, and build configuration.

```toml
[package]
name = "my_bevy_game"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["You <you@veryrealemail.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
```

### Add Bevy to your project's Cargo.toml

Bevy is [available as a library on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy), the official Rust package repository. Find the latest version number ([![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bevy.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)) and add it to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[package]
name = "my_bevy_game"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["You <you@veryrealemail.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
bevy = "0.5" # make sure this is the latest version
```

### Build Bevy

Now run `cargo run` again. The Bevy dependencies should start building. This will take some time as you are essentially building an engine from scratch. You will only need to do a full rebuild once. Every build after this one will be fast!

Now that we have our Bevy project set up, we're ready to start making our first Bevy app!

## Troubleshooting

Having trouble getting Bevy running?
Take a look at these known problems and how to solve them.

### Unable to find a GPU

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'Unable to find a GPU! Make sure you have installed required drivers!'
```

This error message means that bevy is unable to draw to your screen.
Causes include:

1. Vulkan-compatible drivers not installed. To fix this, install/update the drivers. On Linux this may be `vulkan-intel` or `vulkan-radeon`.
2. Trying to run an example on a headless machine. To fix this, install a GPU!

### Use of unstable features

Bevy's minimum Rust version is "latest stable".
If your compiler is complaining that `bevy` is using unstable features, update your rust version using `rustup update`.
