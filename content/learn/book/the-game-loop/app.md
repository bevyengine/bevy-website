An [`App`] is the entry-point to a bevy game.
Apps exist to configure bevy before start up: registering [systems], initializing [resources], and registering [events], and so on.
Once configured, an app can be started with [`App::run`].
This takes control of the main thread and enters the game loop.

You can think of an `App` as containing three things:
+ A [world], which stores all the data for the app.
+ A run-loop function, to execute [schedules].
+ A set of [plugins], which are important enough to deserve their own section.

Most app configuration -- registering systems, etc. -- boils down to modifying the world. 
To simplify this, [`App`] proxies most of the [`World`] API.
The world can also be accessed directly via [`App::world_mut`].

The main thing that distinguishes an [`App`] from a world is the runner function. 
It's this function that defines the game loop, and like everything else in bevy it's configurable:
You can manually set a runner with [`App::set_runner`], but you shouldn't have to:
When using `DefaultPlugins` or `MinimalPlugins` the runner is set for you.
We will take a closer look at the runner function in the [scheduling] chapter.
