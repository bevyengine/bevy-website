Sometimes you may need to preserve some state between executions of a [system].
For this, we have the [`Local<T>`] system parameter.

Any type that implements `Default` can be stored in a local. `Default` is required so that the value can be initialized before the system runs. If your type does not implement `Default`, you can use `Option<T>` instead.
