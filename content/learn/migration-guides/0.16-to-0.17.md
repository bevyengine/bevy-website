### `Handle::Weak` has been replaced by `Handle::Uuid`.

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19896]) }}

`Handle::Weak` had some weird behavior. It allowed for a sprite to be given a handle that is dropped
**while the sprite is still using it**. This also resulted in more complexity in the asset system.
The primary remaining use for `Handle::Weak` is to store asset UUIDs initialized through the
`weak_handle!` macro. To address this, `Handle::Weak` has been replaced by `Handle::Uuid`!

Users using the `weak_handle!` macro should switch to the `uuid_handle!` macro.

```rust
// Before
const IMAGE: Handle<Image> = weak_handle!("b20988e9-b1b9-4176-b5f3-a6fa73aa617f");

// After
const IMAGE: Handle<Image> = uuid_handle!("b20988e9-b1b9-4176-b5f3-a6fa73aa617f");
```

Users using `Handle::clone_weak` can (most likely) just call `Handle::clone` instead.

```rust
// Somewhere in some startup system.
let my_sprite_image = asset_server.load("monster.png");

// In game code...
// This sprite could be unloaded even if the sprite is still using it!
commands.spawn(Sprite::from_image(my_sprite_image.clone_weak()));

// Just do this instead!
commands.spawn(Sprite::from_image(my_sprite_image.clone()));
```

Users using the `Handle::Weak` variant directly should consider replacing it with `AssetId` instead,
accessible through `Handle::id`. These situations are very case-by-case migrations.

P.S., for users of the `weak_handle!` macro: If you are using it for shaders, consider switching to
`load_shader_library`/`load_embedded_asset` instead (especially replacing `load_internal_asset`).
This enables hot reloading for your shaders - which Bevy internally has done this cycle!

### Deprecate `iter_entities` and `iter_entities_mut`.

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20260]) }}

In Bevy 0.17.0 we deprecate `world.iter_entities()` and `world.iter_entities_mut()`.
Use `world.query::<EntityMut>().iter(&world)` and `world.query::<EntityRef>().iter(&mut world)` instead.

This may not return every single entity, because of [default filter queries](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/entity_disabling/index.html). If you really intend to query disabled entities too, consider removing the `DefaultQueryFilters` resource from the world before querying the elements. You can also add an `Allow<Component>` filter to allow a specific disabled `Component` to show up in the query.

### `EntityRef`, `EntityMut`, and `Option<&Disabled>` no longer ignore default query filters

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20163]) }}

Previously, `Query<EntityRef>` would include entities with a `Disabled` component,
even though queries like `Query<Entity>` and `Query<()>` would not.
To make this more consistent, `EntityRef` and `EntityMut` no longer disable all default query filters.
As a side-effect, `Option<&Disabled>` will *also* no longer disable a default query filter.

If you want to include entities with a default query filter like `Disabled`,
you will need to add an `Allows<Disabled>` query filter
or a `Has<Disabled>` query data.

```rust
// 0.16
// This query would include all entities, even `Disabled` ones
fn entity_system(query: Query<EntityRef>)
// This query would include `Disabled` entities, but respect other filters
fn option_system(query: Query<Option<&Disabled>>)
// This dynamic query would include `Disabled` entities, but respect other filters
let query = QueryBuilder::<Entity>::new(&mut world)
    .optional(|builder| {
        builder.data::<&CustomDisabled>();
    })
    .build();

// 0.17
// Now we need to explicitly allow `Disabled` entities if we want to query them
fn entity_system(query: Query<EntityRef, Allows<Disabled>>)
// Consider replacing `Option<&Disabled>` with `Has<Disabled>`
fn option_system(query: Query<Has<Disabled>>)
// Dynamic queries can also use `Allows` to include `Disabled` entities
let query = QueryBuilder::<Entity>::new(&mut world)
    .filter::<Allows<CustomDisabled>>()
    .build();
```

### `RelativeCursorPosition` is now object-centered

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[16615]) }}

When picking objects, `RelativeCursorPosition`'s coordinates are now object-centered with (0,0) at the center of the node and the corners at (±0.5, ±0.5). Its `normalized_visible_node_rect` field has been removed and replaced with a new `cursor_over: bool` field which is set to true when the cursor is hovering a visible section of the UI node.

### `Text2d` moved to `bevy_sprite`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20594]) }}

The world-space text types `Text2d` and `Text2dShadow` have been moved to the `bevy_sprite` crate, along with their associated systems.
Import them directly or from `bevy::sprite` now.

### `SyncCell` and `SyncUnsafeCell` moved to bevy_platform

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19305]) }}

`bevy_utils::synccell::SyncCell` is now `bevy_platform::cell::SyncCell`
`bevy_utils::syncunsafecell::SyncUnsafeCell` is now `bevy_platform::cell::SyncUnsafeCell`

### Renamed `Condition` to `SystemCondition`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19328]) }}

The `Condition` trait is now called `SystemCondition`. Replace all references and imports.

This change was made because `Condition` is an overly generic name that collides too often and is rarely used directly, despite appearing in the prelude.

### Observers and one-shot systems are now marked as `Internal`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20204]) }}

Bevy 0.17 introduces internal entities. Entities tagged by the `Internal` component that are hidden from most queries using [`DefaultQueryFilters`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/entity_disabling/index.html).

Currently, both [`Observer`s](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/observer/struct.Observer.html) and systems that are registered through [`World::register_system`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/prelude/struct.World.html#method.register_system) are considered internal entities.

If you queried them before, add the `Allow<Internal>` filter to the query to bypass the default filter.

### `SceneSpawner` methods have been renamed and replaced

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18358]) }}

Some methods on `SceneSpawner` have been renamed:
    - `despawn` -> `despawn_dynamic`
    - `despawn_sync` -> `despawn_dynamic_sync`
    - `update_spawned_scenes` -> `update_spawned_dynamic_scenes`

In their place, we've added `despawn`, `despawn_sync`, and `update_spawned_scenes` which all act on
`Scene`s (as opposed to `DynamicScene`s).

### `Location` is no longer a `Component`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19306]) }}

`bevy_picking::Location` was erroneously made a `Component`. It is no longer one. `bevy_picking::PointerLocation` wraps a `Location` and is the component you should be using instead.

### Remove `scale_value`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19143]) }}

The `scale_value` function from `bevy::text::text2d` has been removed. Multiply by the scale factor instead.

### `Assets::insert` and `Assets::get_or_insert_with` now return `Result`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20439]) }}

In previous versions of Bevy, there was a bug where inserting an asset into an `AssetId` whose handle was dropped would result in a panic. Now this is an error! Calling `Assets::insert` and
`Assets::get_or_insert_with` returns an error you can inspect.

To match the previous behavior, just `unwrap()` the result.

### Enable Wayland by default

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19232]) }}

Wayland has now been added to the default features of the `bevy` crate.

```
  called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value:
  pkg-config exited with status code 1
  > PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_LIBS=1 PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_CFLAGS=1 pkg-config --libs --cflags wayland-client

  The system library `wayland-client` required by crate `wayland-sys` was not found.
  The file `wayland-client.pc` needs to be installed and the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable must contain its parent directory.
  The PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable is not set.

  HINT: if you have installed the library, try setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the directory containing `wayland-client.pc`.
```

If you've encountered an error message similar to the one above, this means that you will want to make the `wayland-client` library available to your build system, or disable default features, in order to successfully build Bevy on Linux.

On Ubuntu, or other Debian-based distributions, install the `libwayland-dev` package:

```sh
sudo apt install libwayland-dev
```

On Arch Linux:

```sh
sudo pacman -S wayland
```

On Nix, add the `wayland` package to your `buildInputs`:

```nix
buildInputs = [ pkgs.wayland ];
```

### Generic `Option` Parameter

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18766]) }}

`Option<Single<D, F>>` will now resolve to `None` if there are multiple entities matching the query.
Previously, it would only resolve to `None` if there were no entities, and would skip the system if there were multiple.

We have introduced a blanket `impl SystemParam for Option` that resolves to `None` if the parameter is invalid.
This allows third-party system parameters to work with `Option`, and makes the behavior more consistent.

If you want a system to run when there are no matching entities but skip when there are multiple,
you will need to use `Query<D, F>` and call `single()` yourself.

```rust
// 0.16
fn my_system(single: Option<Single<&Player>>) {
}

// 0.17
fn my_system(query: Query<&Player>) {
    let result = query.single();
    if matches!(r, Err(QuerySingleError(MultipleEntities(_)))) {
        return;
    }
    let single: Option<&Player> = r.ok();
}
```

### Stop exposing mp3 support through minimp3

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20183]) }}

The `minimp3` feature is no longer exposed from Bevy. Bevy still supports mp3 through the `mp3` feature.

If you were relying on something specific to `minimp3`, you can still enable it by adding a dependency to `rodio` with the `minimp3` feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
rodio = { version = "0.20", features = ["minimp3"] }
```

This is best to avoid though, as `minimp3` is not actively maintained, doesn't work in wasm, has been known to cause application rejection from the Apple App Store, and has a few security vulnerabilities.

### Schedule API Cleanup

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19352, 20119, 20172, 20256]) }}

In order to support removing systems from schedules, `Vec`s storing `System`s and
`SystemSet`s have been replaced with `SlotMap`s which allow safely removing nodes and
reusing indices. The maps are respectively keyed by `SystemKey`s and `SystemSetKey`s.

The following signatures were changed:

- `DiGraph` and `UnGraph` now have an additional, required type parameter `N`, which
  is a `GraphNodeId`. Use `DiGraph<NodeId>`/`UnGraph<NodeId>` for the equivalent to the previous type.
- `NodeId::System`: Now stores a `SystemKey` instead of a plain `usize`
- `NodeId::Set`: Now stores a `SystemSetKey` instead of a plain `usize`
- `ScheduleBuildPass::collapse_set`: Now takes the type-specific keys.
  Wrap them back into a `NodeId` if necessary.
- `ScheduleBuildPass::build`: Now takes a `DiGraph<SystemKey>` instead of `DiGraph<NodeId>`.
  Re-wrap the keys back into `NodeId` if necessary.
- The following functions now return the type-specific keys. Wrap them back into a `NodeId` if necessary.
  - `Schedule::systems`
  - `ScheduleGraph::conflicting_systems`
- `ScheduleBuildError` variants now contain `NodeId` or type-specific keys, rather than `String`s.
  Use `ScheduleBuildError::to_string` to render the nodes' names and get the old error messages.
- `ScheduleGraph::build_schedule` now returns a `Vec<ScheduleBuildWarning>` in addition to the built
  `SystemSchedule`. Use standard `Result` functions to grab just the `SystemSchedule`, if needed.

The following functions were replaced. Those that took or returned `NodeId` now
take or return `SystemKey` or `SystemSetKey`. Wrap/unwrap them as necessary.

- `ScheduleGraph::contains_set`: Use `ScheduleGraph::system_sets` and `SystemSets::contains`.
- `ScheduleGraph::get_set_at`: Use `ScheduleGraph::system_sets` and `SystemSets::get`.
- `ScheduleGraph::set_at`: Use `ScheduleGraph::system_sets` and `SystemSets::index` (`system_sets[key]`).
- `ScheduleGraph::get_set_conditions_at`: Use `ScheduleGraph::system_sets` and `SystemSets::get_conditions`.
- `ScheduleGraph::system_sets`: Use `ScheduleGraph::system_sets` and `SystemSets::iter`.
- `ScheduleGraph::get_system_at`: Use `ScheduleGraph::systems` and `Systems::get`.
- `ScheduleGraph::system_at`: Use `ScheduleGraph::systems` and `Systems::index` (`systems[key]`).
- `ScheduleGraph::systems`: Use `ScheduleGraph::systems` and `Systems::iter`.

The following enum variants were replaced:

- `ScheduleBuildError::HierarchyRedundancy` with `ScheduleBuildError::Elevated(ScheduleBuildWarning::HierarchyRedundancy)`
- `ScheduleBuildError::Ambiguity` with `ScheduleBuildError::Elevated(ScheduleBuildWarning::Ambiguity)`

The following functions were removed:

- `NodeId::index`: You should match on and use the `SystemKey` and `SystemSetKey` instead.
- `NodeId::cmp`: Use the `PartialOrd` and `Ord` traits instead.
- `ScheduleGraph::set_conditions_at`: If needing to check presence of conditions,
  use `ScheduleGraph::system_sets` and `SystemSets::has_conditions`.
  Otherwise, use `SystemSets::get_conditions`.

### `bevy_render` reorganization

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20485, 20330, 18703, 20587, 20502, 19997, 19991, 20000, 19949, 19943, 19953, 20498, 20496, 20493, 20492, 20491, 20488, 20487, 20486, 20483, 20480, 20479, 20478, 20477, 20473, 20472, 20471, 20470, 20392, 20390, 20388, 20345, 20344, 20051, 19985, 19973, 19965, 19963, 19962, 19960, 19959, 19958, 19957, 19956, 19955, 19954, 16620, 16619, 15700, 15666, 15650, 20778, 20857, 18323]) }}

You must now import `bevy_render::NormalizedRenderTargetExt` to use methods on `NormalizedRenderTarget`
`ManualTextureViews` is now in `bevy_render::texture`

Camera types such as `Camera`, `Camera3d`, `Camera2d`, `ClearColor`, `ClearColorConfig`, `Exposure`, `Projection`, `PerspectiveProjection`, and `OrthographicProjection` have been moved to a new crate, `bevy_camera`.
Visibility types such as `Visibility`, `InheritedVisibility`, `ViewVisibility`, `VisibleEntities`, and `RenderLayers` have been moved to `bevy_camera::visibility`.
Culling primitives such as `Frustum`, `HalfSpace`, `Aabb`, and `Sphere` have been moved to `bevy_camera::primitives`.
Import them directly or from `bevy::camera` now.

Shader types such as `Shader`, `ShaderRef`, `ShaderDef`, `ShaderCache`, and `PipelineCompilationError` have been moved to a new crate, `bevy_shader`.
Import them directly or from `bevy::shader` now.

Light types such `AmbientLight`, `PointLight`, `SpotLight`, `DirectionalLight`, `EnvironmentMapLight`, `GeneratedEnvironmentMapLight`, `LightProbe`, `IrradianceVolume`, `VolumetricFog`, `FogVolume`, `CascadeShadowConfigBuilder`, `NotShadowCaster`, `NotShadowReceiver` and `light_consts` have been moved to a new crate, `bevy_light`.
Import them directly or from `bevy::light` now.

Mesh types such as `Mesh`, `Mesh3d`, `Mesh2d`, `MorphWeights`, `MeshBuilder`, `Indices`, and `Meshable` have been moved to a new crate, `bevy_mesh`.
Import them directly or from `bevy::mesh` now. This crate is actually present in the previous release, but its `bevy_render` re-exports have now been removed.

Image types such as `Image`, `ImagePlugin`, `ImageFormat`, `ImageSampler`, `ImageAddressMode`, `ImageSamplerDescriptor`, `ImageCompareFunction`, and `ImageSamplerBorderColor` have been moved to a new crate, `bevy_image`. This crate is actually present in the previous release, but its `bevy_render` re-exports have now been removed.
Import them directly or from `bevy::image` now.

Ui rendering types such as `MaterialNode`, `UiMaterial`, `UiMaterialKey`, and modules `bevy_ui::render` and `bevy_ui::ui_material` have been moved to a new crate, `bevy_ui_render`.
Import them directly or from `bevy::ui_render` now.
Furthermore, `UiPlugin` no longer has any fields. To control whether or not UI is rendered, enable or disable `UiRenderPlugin`, which is included in the DefaultPlugins.
If you were manually enabling "bevy_ui" feature on bevy, you probably want to enable "bevy_ui_render" feature instead now if you are using rendering features.

Sprite rendering types such as `Material2d`, `Material2dPlugin`, `MeshMaterial2d`, `AlphaMode2d`, `Wireframe2d`, `TileData`, `TilemapChunk`, and `TilemapChunkTileData` have been moved to a new crate, `bevy_sprite_render`.
Import them directly or from `bevy::sprite_render` now.
If you were manually enabling "bevy_sprite" feature on bevy, you probably want to enable "bevy_sprite_render" feature instead now if you are using rendering features such as 2d gizmos.

`RenderAssetUsages` is no longer re-exported by `bevy_render`.
Import it from `bevy_asset` or `bevy::asset` instead.

`bevy_core_pipeline` used to be home to many non-core things, including post process effects.
They have now been given a new home in `bevy_anti_alias` and `bevy_post_process`.

If you were importing FxaaPlugin, SmaaPlugin, TemporalAntiAliasPlugin, or CasPlugin from `bevy_core_pipeline` or `bevy::core_pipeline`, you must now import them from `bevy_anti_alias` or `bevy::anti_alias`.

If you were importing Bloom, AutoExposure, ChromaticAberration, DepthOfField, or MotionBlur from `bevy_core_pipeline` or `bevy::core_pipeline`, you must now import them from `bevy_post_process` or `bevy::post_process`.

Additionally, you may now order rendering passes against the new `StartMainPassPostProcessing` node.

### Rename `Pointer<Pressed>` and `Pointer<Released>` to `Pointer<Press>` and `Pointer<Release>`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19179]) }}

The `Pointer<Pressed>` and `Pointer<Released>` events have been renamed to `Pointer<Press>` and `Pointer<Release>` for improved consistency. `Pressed` is now a marker component indicating that a button or other UI node is in a pressed or "held down" state.

### `YAxisOrientation` has been removed

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19077]) }}

The `YAxisOrientation` component has been removed from `bevy_text`. The correct y-axis orientation is now chosen automatically by the text systems.

### Renamed `Timer::paused` to `Timer::is_paused` and `Timer::finished` to `Timer::is_finished`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19386]) }}

The following changes were made:

- `Timer::paused` is now `Timer::is_paused`
- `Timer::finished` is now `Timer::is_finished`

This change was made to align the `Timer` public API with that of `Time` and `Stopwatch`.

### glTF animation loading is now optional

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20750]) }}

`GltfLoaderSettings` now has a `load_animations` field which allows controlling whether animations should load.

### Fixed UI draw order and `stack_z_offsets` changes

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19691]) }}

The draw order of some renderable UI elements relative to others wasn't fixed and depended on system ordering.
In particular the ordering of background colors and texture sliced images was sometimes swapped.

The UI draw order is now fixed.
The new order is (back-to-front):

1. Box shadows
2. Node background colors
3. Node borders
4. Gradients
5. Border Gradients
6. Images (including texture-sliced images)
7. Materials
8. Text (including text shadows)

The values of the `stack_z_offsets` constants have been updated to enforce the new ordering. Other changes:

- `NODE` is renamed to `BACKGROUND_COLOR`
- `TEXTURE_SLICE` is removed, use `IMAGE`.
- New `BORDER`, `BORDER_GRADIENT` and `TEXT` constants.

### `RemovedComponents` methods renamed to match `Event` to `Message` rename

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20953, 20954]) }}

As part of the broader shift to differentiate between buffered events (0.16's `EventWriter`/`EventReader`) and observer-events,
various methods and types related to `RemovedComponents` have been renamed.

The implementation of `RemovedComponents` uses buffered events (now, messages):
and as a result, the following types and messages have been renamed:

| Old                                         | New                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `RemovedComponents::events`                 | `RemovedComponents::messages`                 |
| `RemovedComponents::reader_mut_with_events` | `RemovedComponents::reader_mut_with_messages` |
| `RemovedComponentEvents`                    | `RemovedComponentMessages`                    |

### Window is now split into multiple components

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19668]) }}

`Window` has become a very large component over the last few releases. To improve our internal handling of it and to make it more approachable, we
have split it into multiple components, all on the same entity. So far, this affects `CursorOptions`:

```rust
// old
fn lock_cursor(primary_window: Single<&mut Window, With<PrimaryWindow>>) {
    primary_window.cursor_options.grab_mode = CursorGrabMode::Locked;
}

// new
fn lock_cursor(primary_cursor_options: Single<&mut CursorOptions, With<PrimaryWindow>>) {
    primary_cursor_options.grab_mode = CursorGrabMode::Locked;
}
```

This split also applies when specifying the initial settings for the primary window:

```rust
// old
app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(WindowPlugin {
    primary_window: Some(Window {
        cursor_options: CursorOptions {
            grab_mode: CursorGrabMode::Locked,
            ..default()
        },
        ..default()
    }),
    ..default()
}));

// new
app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(WindowPlugin {
    primary_cursor_options: Some(CursorOptions {
        grab_mode: CursorGrabMode::Locked,
        ..default()
    }),
    ..default()
}));
```

### Removed `cosmic_text` re-exports

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19516]) }}

Previously, `bevy_text` re-exported the entirety of `cosmic_text` while renaming a few of the most confusing re-exports,
using the following code.

```rust
pub use cosmic_text::{
    self, FamilyOwned as FontFamily, Stretch as FontStretch, Style as FontStyle, Weight as FontWeight,
};
```

These re-exports commonly conflicted with other types (like `Query`!), leading to messy autocomplete errors.
Ultimately, these are largely an implementation detail, and were not widely used.

We've completely removed these re-exports (including the renamed types): if you need to use these types, please rely on them directly from `cosmic_text`, being sure that the version number you are using matches the version used by your version of `bevy_text`.

### Rename `send_event` and similar methods to `write_message`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20017, 20953]) }}

Following up on the `EventWriter::send` being renamed to `EventWriter::write` in 0.16, many similar methods have been renamed. Note that "buffered events" are now known as `Messages`, and the naming reflects that here.

This includes both the `World` and `Commands` message methods. The old methods have been depreciated.

| Old                                 | New                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `World::send_event`                 | `World::write_message`                 |
| `World::send_event_default`         | `World::write_message_default`         |
| `World::send_event_batch`           | `World::write_message_batch`           |
| `DeferredWorld::send_event`         | `DeferredWorld::write_message`         |
| `DeferredWorld::send_event_default` | `DeferredWorld::write_message_default` |
| `DeferredWorld::send_event_batch`   | `DeferredWorld::write_message_batch`   |
| `Commands::send_event`              | `Commands::write_message`              |
| `Events::send`                      | `Messages::write`                      |
| `Events::send_default`              | `Messages::write_default`              |
| `Events::send_batch`                | `Messages::write_batch`                |
| `RemovedComponentEvents::send`      | `RemovedComponentEvents::write`        |
| `command::send_event`               | `command::write_message`               |

### Move UI Debug Options from `bevy_ui` to `bevy_ui_render`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18703]) }}

The `UiDebugOptions` resource used for controlling the UI Debug Overlay has been moved from the internal `bevy_ui` crate to the `bevy_ui_render` crate, and is now accessible from the prelude of `bevy_ui_render` and, as before, from the prelude of `bevy`:

```rust
// 0.16
use bevy::prelude::*;
// or
use bevy::ui::UiDebugOptions;

// 0.17
use bevy::prelude::*;
// or, if you are not using the full `bevy` crate:
// use bevy_ui_render::prelude::*;

let options = world.resource_mut::<UiDebugOptions>();
```

### `CloneBehavior` is no longer `PartialEq` or `Eq`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18393]) }}

`CloneBehavior` no longer implements `PartialEq` or `Eq` and thus does not work with the `==` and `!=` operators, as the internal
comparisons involve comparing function pointers which may result in unexpected results.

Use pattern matching to check for equality instead:

```rust
// 0.16
if clone_behavior == CloneBehavior::Ignore {
   ...
}

// 0.17
if matches!(clone_behavior, CloneBehavior::Ignore) {
   ...
}
```

### Interned labels and `DynEq`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18984]) }}

- `DynEq::as_any` has been removed. Use `&value as &dyn Any` instead.
- `DynHash::as_dyn_eq` has been removed. Use `&value as &dyn DynEq` instead.
- `as_dyn_eq` has been removed from 'label' types such as `ScheduleLabel` and `SystemSet`. Call `DynEq::dyn_eq` directly on the label instead.

### Split `Hdr` from `Camera`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18873]) }}

`Camera.hdr` has been split out into a new marker component, `Hdr`, which can be found at `bevy::render::view::Hdr`.

- before: `commands.spawn((Camera3d, Camera { hdr: true, ..default() });`
- after: `commands.spawn((Camera3d, Hdr));`
- rendering effects can now `#[require(Hdr)]` if they only function with an HDR camera.
  This is currently implemented for `Bloom`, `AutoExposure`, and `Atmosphere`

### The render target info from `ComputedUiTargetCamera` has been removed.

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20535]) }}

The render target info, scale factor and physical size, has been removed from `ComputedUiTargetCamera` and placed into a new component `ComputedUiRenderTargetInfo`.

### Reflection-based maps are now unordered

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19802]) }}

`DynamicMap` is now unordered, and the `Map` trait no longer assumes implementors to be ordered. If you previously relied on them being ordered, you should now store a list of keys (`Vec<Box<dyn PartialReflect>>`) separately.

`Map::get_at` and `Map::get_at_mut` are now removed. You should no longer use `usize` to index into the map, and instead use `&dyn PartialReflect` with `Map::get` and `Map::get_mut`.

`PartialReflect::apply(self, other)` for maps now removes excess entries (entries present in `self` which are not present in `other`).
If you need those entries to be preserved, you will need to re-insert them manually.

### Rework `MergeMeshError`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18561]) }}

`MergeMeshError` was reworked to account for the possibility of the meshes being merged having two different `PrimitiveTopology`'s, and was renamed to `MeshMergeError` to align with the naming of other mesh errors.

- Users will need to rename `MergeMeshError` to `MeshMergeError`
- When handling `MergeMeshError` (now `MeshMergeError`), users will need to account for the new `IncompatiblePrimitiveTopology` variant, as it has been changed from a struct to an enum
- `Mesh::merge` now returns `Result<(), MeshMergeError>` instead of the previous `Result<(), MergeMeshError>`

### Use glTF material names for spawned primitive entities

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19287]) }}

When loading a glTF scene in Bevy, each mesh primitive will generate an entity and store a `GltfMaterialName` component and `Name` component.

The `Name` components were previously stored as mesh name plus primitive index - for example, `MeshName.0` and `MeshName.1`. To make it easier to view these entities in Inspector-style tools, they are now stored as mesh name plus material name - for example, `MeshName.Material1Name` and `MeshName.Material2Name`.

If you were relying on the previous value of the `Name` component on meshes, use the new `GltfMeshName` component instead.

### `ViewRangefinder3d::from_world_from_view` now takes `Affine3A` instead of `Mat4`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20707]) }}

`ViewRangefinder3d::from_world_from_view` now takes `Affine3A` instead of `Mat4`. If you were supplying a `GlobalTransform::to_matrix()`, simply use `GlobalTransform::affine()` now. Performance will be better.

### Original target of `Pointer` picking events is now stored on observers

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19663]) }}

The `Pointer.target` field, which tracks the original target of the pointer event before bubbling, has been removed.
Instead, all "bubbling entity event" observers now track this information, available via the `On::original_event_target()` method.

If you were using this information via the Pointer API of picking, please migrate to observers.
If you cannot for performance reasons, please open an issue explaining your exact use case!

As a workaround, you can transform any entity-event into a Message that contains the targeted entity using an observer than writes messages.

```rust
#[derive(Message)]
struct EntityEventMessage<E: EntityEvent> {
    entity: Entity,
    event: E,
}

// A generic observer that handles this transformation
fn transform_entity_event<E: EntityEvent>(event: On<E>, message_writer: MessageWriter<EntityEventMessage<E>>){
    if event.entity() == event.original_event_target() {
        message_writer.send(EntityEventMessage {
            event: event.event().clone(),
            entity: event.entity(),
        );
    }
}
```

### Remove the `Add`/`Sub` impls on `Volume`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19423]) }}

Linear volumes are like percentages, and it does not make sense to add or subtract percentages.
As such, use the new `increase_by_percentage` function instead of addition or subtraction.

```rust
// 0.16
fn audio_system() {
    let linear_a = Volume::Linear(0.5);
    let linear_b = Volume::Linear(0.1);
    let linear_c = linear_a + linear_b;
    let linear_d = linear_a - linear_b;
}

// 0.17
fn audio_system() {
    let linear_a = Volume::Linear(0.5);
    let linear_b = Volume::Linear(0.1);
    let linear_c = linear_a.increase_by_percentage(10.0);
    let linear_d = linear_a.increase_by_percentage(-10.0);
}
```

### Renamed `ComputedNodeTarget` and `update_ui_context_system`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20519, 20532]) }}

`ComputedNodeTarget` has been renamed to `ComputedUiTargetCamera`. New name chosen because the component's value is derived from `UiTargetCamera`.

`update_ui_context_system` has been renamed to `propagate_ui_target_cameras`.

### ChromaticAberration LUT is now Option

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19408]) }}

The `ChromaticAberration` component `color_lut` field use to be a regular `Handle<Image>`. Now, it
is an `Option<Handle<Image>>` which falls back to the default image when `None`. For users assigning
a custom LUT, just wrap the value in `Some`.

### Extract `PointerInputPlugin` members into `PointerInputSettings`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19078]) }}

Toggling mouse and touch input update for picking should be done through
the `PointerInputSettings` resource instead of `PointerInputPlugin`.

To initialize `PointerInputSettings` with non-default values, simply add
the resource to the app using `insert_resource` with the desired value.

### `DragEnter` now includes the dragged entity

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19179]) }}

`DragEnter` events are now triggered when entering any entity, even the originally dragged one. This makes the behavior more consistent.

The old behavior can be achieved by checking if trigger.entity != trigger.dragged

### Separate Border Colors

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18682]) }}

The `BorderColor` struct now contains separate fields for each edge, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`. To keep the existing behavior, replace `BorderColor(color)` with `BorderColor::all(color)`, and `border_color.0 = new_color` with `*border_color = BorderColor::all(new_color)`.

### `ScrollPosition` now uses logical pixel units and is no longer overwritten during layout updates

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20093]) }}

`ScrollPosition` is no longer overwritten during layout updates. Instead the computed scroll position is stored in the new `scroll_position` field on `ComputedNode`.

### Combine now takes an extra parameter

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20689]) }}

The `Combine::combine` method now takes an extra parameter that needs to be passed mutably to the two given closures. This allows fixing a soundness issue which manifested when the two closures were called re-entrantly.

### Fix `From<Rot2>` implementation for `Mat2`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20522]) }}

Past releases had an incorrect `From<Rot2>` implementation for `Mat2`, constructing a rotation matrix in the following form:

```
[  cos, sin ]
[ -sin, cos ]
```

This was actually the _inverse_ of the rotation matrix, resulting in clockwise rotation when transforming vectors.
The correct version is the following:

```
[ cos, -sin ]
[ sin,  cos ]
```

resulting in counterclockwise rotation.

This error has now been fixed. You may see that rotation matrices created using the `From<Rot2>` implementation
produce different results than before, as the rotation happens counterclockwise (as intended) rather than clockwise.
Invert either the input `Rot2` or the resulting `Mat2` to get the same results as before.

### Extract `PickingPlugin` members into `PickingSettings`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19078]) }}

Controlling the behavior of picking should be done through
the `PickingSettings` resource instead of `PickingPlugin`.

To initialize `PickingSettings` with non-default values, simply add
the resource to the app using `insert_resource` with the desired value.

### Consistent `*Systems` naming convention for system sets

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18900]) }}

System sets in Bevy now more consistently use a `Systems` suffix.
Renamed types include:

- `AccessibilitySystem` → `AccessibilitySystems`
- `GizmoRenderSystem` → `GizmoRenderSystems`
- `PickSet` → `PickingSystems`
- `RunFixedMainLoopSystem` → `RunFixedMainLoopSystems`
- `TransformSystem` → `TransformSystems`
- `RemoteSet` → `RemoteSystems`
- `RenderSet` → `RenderSystems`
- `SpriteSystem` → `SpriteSystems`
- `StateTransitionSteps` → `StateTransitionSystems`
- `RenderUiSystem` → `RenderUiSystems`
- `UiSystem` → `UiSystems`
- `Animation` → `AnimationSystems`
- `AssetEvents` → `AssetEventSystems`
- `TrackAssets` → `AssetTrackingSystems`
- `UpdateGizmoMeshes` → `GizmoMeshSystems`
- `InputSystem` → `InputSystems`
- `InputFocusSet` → `InputFocusSystems`
- `ExtractMaterialsSet` → `MaterialExtractionSystems`
- `ExtractMeshesSet` → `MeshExtractionSystems`
- `RumbleSystem` → `RumbleSystems`
- `CameraUpdateSystem` → `CameraUpdateSystems`
- `ExtractAssetsSet` → `AssetExtractionSystems`
- `Update2dText` → `Text2dUpdateSystems`
- `TimeSystem` → `TimeSystems`
- `EventUpdates` → `EventUpdateSystems`

To improve consistency within the ecosystem, it is recommended for ecosystem crates
and users to also adopt the `*Systems` naming convention for their system sets where applicable.

### `System::run` returns `Result`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19145]) }}

In order to support fallible systems and parameter-based system skipping like `Single` and `If<T>` in more places, `System::run` and related methods now return a `Result` instead of a plain value.

If you were calling `System::run`, `System::run_unsafe`, `System::run_without_applying_deferred`, or `ReadOnlySystem::run_readonly`, the simplest solution is to `unwrap()` the resulting `Result`.
The only case where an infallible system will return `Err` is an invalid parameter, such as a missing resource, and those cases used to panic.

If you were calling them from a function that returns `Result<T, BevyError>`, you can instead use the `?` operator.

`System::run`, `System::run_without_applying_deferred`, and `ReadOnlySystem::run_readonly` will now call `System::validate_param_unsafe` and return `Err` if validation fails.
If you were calling `validate_param` or `validate_param_unsafe` before calling one of those, it is no longer necessary.
Note that `System::run_unsafe` still does _not_ perform validation.

If you were manually implementing `System`, the return type to `run_unsafe` has changed from `Out` to `Result<Out, RunSystemError>`.
If you are implementing an infallible system, simply wrap the return value in `Ok`.
If you were implementing a fallible system and had set `type Out = Result<T, BevyError>;`, instead set `type Out = T;`.

If you have a system function that returns `Result` or `!` and are not restricting the return type, you may get type inference failures like this:

```
error[E0283]: type annotations needed
    --> lib.rs:100:5
     |
100  |     IntoSystem::into_system(example_system);
     |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot infer type of the type parameter `Out` declared on the trait `IntoSystem`
     |
note: multiple `impl`s satisfying `core::result::Result<(), bevy_error::BevyError>: function_system::IntoResult<_>` found
   --> crates\bevy_ecs\src\system\function_system.rs:597:1
```

or

```
error[E0283]: type annotations needed
    --> lib.rs:100:11
    |
100 |     world.run_system_cached(system).unwrap();
    |           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot infer type of the type parameter `O` declared on the method `run_system_cached`
    |
note: multiple `impl`s satisfying `core::result::Result<(), bevy_error::BevyError>: function_system::IntoResult<_>` found
   --> crates\bevy_ecs\src\system\function_system.rs:597:1
```

A function that returns `Result<T, BevyError>` may be considered either a fallible system that returns `T` or an infallible system that returns `Result`, and a function that returns `!` may be considered a system that returns _any_ type.
You should be able to resolve them by providing an explicit type for `System::Out`.

```rust
fn example_system() -> Result { Ok(()) }
// 0.16 - Output type is inferred to be `Result`
IntoSystem::into_system(example_system)
// 0.17 - Output type can be either `()` or `Result` and must be written explicitly
IntoSystem::<_, (), _>::into_system(example_system);
IntoSystem::<_, Result, _>::into_system(example_system);

// 0.16 - Output type is inferred to be `Result`
world.run_system_cached(example_system).unwrap().unwrap();
// 0.17 - Output type can be either `()` or `Result` and must be written explicitly
world.run_system_cached::<(), _, _>(example_system).unwrap();
world.run_system_cached::<Result, _, _>(example_system).unwrap().unwrap();
// or it may be inferred if the output type is specified elsewhere
let _: () = world.run_system_cached(example_system).unwrap();
let r: Result = world.run_system_cached(example_system).unwrap();
```

### `LightVisibilityClass` renamed to `ClusterVisibilityClass`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19986]) }}

When clustered decals were added, they used `LightVisibilityClass` to share the clustering infrastructure.
This revealed that this visibility class wasn't really about lights, but about clustering.
It has been renamed to `ClusterVisibilityClass` and moved to live alongside clustering-specific types.

### Renamed state scoped entities and events

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18818, 19435, 20872]) }}

Previously, Bevy provided the `StateScoped` component and `add_state_scoped_event` method
as a way to remove entities/events when **exiting** a state.

However, it can also be useful to have the opposite behavior,
where entities/events are removed when **entering** a state.
This is now possible with the new `DespawnOnEnter` component and `clear_events_on_enter` method.

To support this addition, the previous method and component have been renamed.
Also, `clear_event_on_exit` (previously `clear_event_on_exit_state`) no longer adds the event automatically, so you must call `App::add_event` manually.

| Before                        | After                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `StateScoped`                 | `DespawnOnExit`                      |
| `clear_state_scoped_entities` | `despawn_entities_on_exit_state`     |
| `add_state_scoped_event`      | `add_event` + `clear_events_on_exit` |

### Renamed `JustifyText` to `Justify`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19522]) }}

`JustifyText` has been renamed to `Justify`.

The `-Text` suffix was inconsistent with the names of other `bevy_text` types and unnecessary since it's natural to assume `Justify` refers to text justification.

### Remove default implementation of `extend_from_iter` from `RelationshipSourceCollection`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20255]) }}

The `extend_from_iter` method in the `RelationshipSourceCollection` trait no longer has a default implementation. If you have implemented a custom relationship source collection, you must now provide your own implementation of this method.

```rust
// Before: method was optional due to default implementation
impl RelationshipSourceCollection for MyCustomCollection {
    // ... other required methods
    // extend_from_iter was automatically provided
}

// After: method is now required
impl RelationshipSourceCollection for MyCustomCollection {
    // ... other required methods
    fn extend_from_iter(&mut self, entities: impl IntoIterator<Item = Entity>) {
        // Use your collection's native extend method if available
        self.extend(entities);
        // Or implement manually if needed:
        // for entity in entities {
        //     self.add(entity);
        // }
    }
}
```

### `AnimationGraph` no longer supports raw AssetIds

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19615]) }}

In previous versions of Bevy, `AnimationGraph` would serialize `Handle<AnimationClip>` as an asset
path, and if that wasn't available it would fallback to serializing `AssetId<AnimationClip>`. In
practice, this was not very useful. `AssetId` is (usually) a runtime-generated ID. This means for an
arbitrary `Handle<AnimationClip>`, it was incredibly unlikely that your handle before serialization
would correspond to the same asset as after serialization.

This confusing behavior has been removed. As a side-effect, any `AnimationGraph`s you previously
saved (via `AnimationGraph::save`) will need to be re-saved. These legacy `AnimationGraph`s can
still be loaded until the next Bevy version. Loading and then saving the `AnimationGraph` again will
automatically migrate the `AnimationGraph`.

If your `AnimationGraph` contained serialized `AssetId`s, you will need to manually load the bytes
of the saved graph, deserialize it into `SerializedAnimationGraph`, and then manually decide how to
migrate those `AssetId`s. Alternatively, you could simply rebuild the graph from scratch and save a
new instance. We expect this to be a very rare situation.

### Unify `ObserverState` and `Observer` components

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18728]) }}

`ObserverState` and `Observer` have been merged into a single component.
now you can use `Observer::with_dynamic_runner` to build custom Observe.

```rust
let observe = unsafe {
    Observer::with_dynamic_runner(|world, trigger_context, event_ptr, trigger_ptr| {
        // do something
    })
    .with_event(event_a)
};
world.spawn(observe);
```

### `take_extract` now returns `dyn FnMut` instead of `dyn Fn`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19926]) }}

Previously, `set_extract` accepted any `Fn`. Now we accept any `FnMut`. For callers of
`set_extract`, there is no difference since `Fn: FnMut`.

However, callers of `take_extract` will now be returned
`Option<Box<dyn FnMut(&mut World, &mut World) + Send>>` instead.

### OpenGL ES `wgpu` backend is no longer supported by default

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20793]) }}

The `gles` backend for `wgpu` is no longer included as a default feature of `bevy_render`. OpenGL support is still
available, but must be explicitly enabled by adding the `bevy_render/gles` feature to your app. This change reflects the
fact that OpenGL support is not tested and that some features may not work as expected or at all. We welcome
contributions to improve OpenGL support in the future.

### `labeled_asset_scope` can now return errors

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19449]) }}

`labeled_asset_scope` now returns a user-specified error type based on their closure. Previously,
users would need to fall back to `begin_labeled_asset` and `add_loaded_labeled_asset` to handle
errors, which is more error-prone. Consider migrating to use `labeled_asset_scope` if this was you!

However, `labeled_asset_scope` closures that don't return errors now needs to A) return Ok, and B)
specify an error type.

If your code previously looked like this:

```rust
labeled_asset_scope(label, |mut load_context| {
  let my_asset = ...;

  my_asset
});
```

You can migrate it to:

```rust
labeled_asset_scope::<_, ()>(label, |mut load_context| {
  let my_asset = ...;

  Ok(my_asset)
}).unwrap();
```

### Make `ScrollPosition` newtype `Vec2`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19881]) }}

`ScrollPosition` now newtypes `Vec2`; its `offset_x` and `offset_y` fields have been removed.

### Move cursor-related types from `bevy_winit` to `bevy_window`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20427]) }}

In an effort to reduce and untangle dependencies, cursor-related types have been moved from the `bevy_winit` crate to the `bevy_window` crate.
The following types have been moved as part of this change:

- `CursorIcon` is now located at `bevy::window::CursorIcon`.
- `CustomCursor` is now located at `bevy::window::CustomCursor`.
- `CustomCursorImage` is now located at `bevy::window::CustomCursorImage`.
- `CustomCursorUrl` is now located at `bevy::window::CustomCursorUrl`.
- on the android platform, `ANDROID_APP` is now located in it's own crate and can be found at `bevy::android::ANDROID_APP`.

### `ExtractedUiNode`'s `stack_index` has been renamed to `z_order` and is now an `f32`.

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19691]) }}

`ExtractedUiNode`’s `stack_index` field has been renamed to `z_order` and its type changed from `u32` to `f32`.
Previously `stack_index` would be converted into an `f32` after extraction during the `Render` schedule, then
offsets would be applied applied to determine draw order before sorting (lowest value rendered first).
For example, a node's fill color is given an offset of `0.` and a box shadow is given an offset of `-0.1`, so that
the shadow will be drawn behind the node.

Changing the field to an `f32`, enables finer control of the UI draw order by allowing these offsets to be applied during extraction,
and fixes a bug affecting the ordering of texture-sliced nodes.

### Changes to Bevy's system parallelism strategy

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[16885]) }}

The scheduler will now prevent systems from running in parallel if there _could_ be an archetype that they conflict on, even if there aren't actually any.
To expand on this, previously, the scheduler would look at the entities that exist to determine if there's any overlap.
Now, it determines it solely on the basis of the function signatures of the systems that are run.
This was done as a performance optimization: while in theory this throws away potential parallelism,
in practice, tests on engine and user code found that scheduling overhead dominates parallelism gains with the current multithreaded executor.
Swapping to this simpler, more conservative test allows us to speed up these checks and improve resource utilization.
There are more improvements planned here, so stay tuned!

To understand what this means, consider the following example. These systems will now conflict even if no entity has both `Player` and `Enemy` components:

```rust
fn player_system(query: Query<(&mut Transform, &Player)>) {}
fn enemy_system(query: Query<(&mut Transform, &Enemy)>) {}
```

To allow them to run in parallel, use `Without` filters, just as you would to allow both queries in a single system:

```rust
// Either one of these changes alone would be enough
fn player_system(query: Query<(&mut Transform, &Player), Without<Enemy>>) {}
fn enemy_system(query: Query<(&mut Transform, &Enemy), Without<Player>>) {}
```

If you encounter a performance regression in your application due to this change, _please_ open an issue.
We would be very interested to understand your use case, see your benchmarking results, and help you mitigate any issues.

### `wgpu` 25

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19563]) }}

`wgpu` 25 introduces a number of breaking changes, most notably in the way Bevy is required to handle
uniforms with dynamic offsets which are used pervasively in the renderer. Dynamic offsets and uniforms
of any kind are no longer allowed to be used in the same bind group as binding arrays. As such, the
following changes to the default bind group numbering have been made in 3d:

- `@group(0)` view binding resources
- `@group(1)` view resources requiring binding arrays
- `@group(2)` mesh binding resources
- `@group(3)` material binding resources

Most users who are not using mid-level render APIs will simply need to switch their material bind groups
from `@group(2)` to `@group(#{MATERIAL_BIND_GROUP})`. The `MATERIAL_BIND_GROUP` shader def has been added
to ensure backwards compatibility in the event the bind group numbering changes again in the future.

Exported float constants from shaders without an explicit type declaration like `const FOO = 1.0;` are no
longer supported and must be explicitly typed like `const FOO: f32 = 1.0;`.

See the [full changelog here](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/trunk/CHANGELOG.md#v2500-2025-04-10).

When migrating shaders or other custom rendering code, you may encounter panics like:

```
wgpu error: Validation Error

Caused by:
  In Device::create_render_pipeline, label = 'pbr_opaque_mesh_pipeline'
    Error matching ShaderStages(FRAGMENT) shader requirements against the pipeline
      Shader global ResourceBinding { group: 2, binding: 100 } is not available in the pipeline layout
        Binding is missing from the pipeline layout

note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
Encountered a panic in system `bevy_render::render_resource::pipeline_cache::PipelineCache::process_pipeline_queue_system`!
```

This error is a result of Bevy's bind group indices changing. Identify the shader by searching for the group and binding mentioned, e.g. `@group(2) @binding(100)`, and follow the above advice to fix the binding group index.

### `Anchor` is now a required component on `Sprite`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18393]) }}

The `anchor` field has been removed from `Sprite`. Instead the `Anchor` component is now a required component on `Sprite`.

The anchor variants have been moved to associated constants, following the table below:

| 0.16                  | 0.17                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Anchor::Center        | Anchor::CENTER        |
| Anchor::BottomLeft    | Anchor::BOTTOM_LEFT   |
| Anchor::BottomCenter  | Anchor::BOTTOM_CENTER |
| Anchor::BottomRight   | Anchor::BOTTOM_RIGHT  |
| Anchor::CenterLeft    | Anchor::CENTER_LEFT   |
| Anchor::CenterRight   | Anchor::CENTER_RIGHT  |
| Anchor::TopLeft       | Anchor::TOP_LEFT      |
| Anchor::TopCenter     | Anchor::TOP_CENTER    |
| Anchor::TopRight      | Anchor::TOP_RIGHT     |

### Many render resources now initialized in `RenderStartup`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19841, 19885, 19886, 19897, 19898, 19901, 19912, 19926, 19999, 20002, 20024, 20124, 20147, 20184, 20194, 20195, 20208, 20209, 20210]) }}

Many render resources are **no longer present** during `Plugin::finish`. Instead they are
initialized during `RenderStartup` (which occurs once the app starts running). If you only access
the resource during the `Render` schedule, then there should be no change. However, if you need one
of these render resources to initialize your own resource, you will need to convert your resource
initialization into a system.

The following are the (public) resources that are now initialized in `RenderStartup`.

- `CasPipeline`
- `FxaaPipeline`
- `SmaaPipelines`
- `TaaPipeline`
- `ShadowSamplers`
- `GlobalClusterableObjectMeta`
- `FallbackBindlessResources`
- `AutoExposurePipeline`
- `MotionBlurPipeline`
- `SkyboxPrepassPipeline`
- `BlitPipeline`
- `DepthOfFieldGlobalBindGroupLayout`
- `DepthPyramidDummyTexture`
- `OitBuffers`
- `PostProcessingPipeline`
- `TonemappingPipeline`
- `BoxShadowPipeline`
- `GradientPipeline`
- `UiPipeline`
- `UiMaterialPipeline<M>`
- `UiTextureSlicePipeline`
- `ScreenshotToScreenPipeline`
- `VolumetricFogPipeline`
- `DeferredLightingLayout`
- `CopyDeferredLightingIdPipeline`
- `RenderLightmaps`
- `PrepassPipeline`
- `PrepassViewBindGroup`
- `Wireframe3dPipeline`
- `ScreenSpaceReflectionsPipeline`
- `MaterialPipeline`
- `MeshletPipelines`
- `MeshletMeshManager`
- `ResourceManager`
- `Wireframe2dPipeline`
- `Material2dPipeline`
- `SpritePipeline`
- `Mesh2dPipeline`
- `BatchedInstanceBuffer<Mesh2dUniform>`

The vast majority of cases for initializing render resources look like so (in Bevy 0.16):

```rust
impl Plugin for MyRenderingPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        // Do nothing??
    }

    fn finish(&self, app: &mut App) {
        let Some(render_app) = app.get_sub_app_mut(RenderApp) else {
            return;
        };

        render_app.init_resource::<MyRenderResource>();
        render_app.add_systems(Render, my_render_system);
    }
}

pub struct MyRenderResource {
    ...
}

impl FromWorld for MyRenderResource {
    fn from_world(world: &mut World) -> Self {
        let render_device = world.resource::<RenderDevice>();
        let render_adapter = world.resource::<RenderAdapter>();
        let asset_server = world.resource::<AssetServer>();

        MyRenderResource {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

The two main things to focus on are:

1. The resource implements the `FromWorld` trait which collects all its dependent resources (most
    commonly, `RenderDevice`), and then creates an instance of the resource.
2. The plugin adds its systems and resources in `Plugin::finish`.

First, we need to rewrite our `FromWorld` implementation as a system. This generally means
converting calls to `World::resource` into system params, and then using `Commands` to insert the
resource. In the above case, that would look like:

```rust
// Just a regular old system!!
fn init_my_resource(
    mut commands: Commands,
    render_device: Res<RenderDevice>,
    render_adapter: Res<RenderAdapter>,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
) {
    commands.insert_resource(MyRenderResource {
        ...
    });
}
```

Each case will be slightly different. Two notes to be wary of:

1. Functions that accept `&RenderDevice` for example may no longer compile after switching to
    `Res<RenderDevice>`. This can be resolved by passing `&render_device` instead of
    `render_device`.
2. If you are using `load_embedded_asset(world, "my_asset.png")`, you may need to first add
    `asset_server` as a system param, then change this to
    `load_embedded_asset(asset_server.as_ref(), "my_asset.png")`.

Now that we have our initialization system, we just need to add the system to `RenderStartup`:

```rust
impl Plugin for MyRenderingPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        let Some(render_app) = app.get_sub_app_mut(RenderApp) else {
            return;
        };

        render_app
            .add_systems(RenderStartup, init_my_resource)
            .add_systems(Render, my_render_system);
    }

    // No more finish!!
}
```

In addition, if your resource requires one of the affected systems above, you will need to use
system ordering to ensure your resource initializes after the other system. For example, if your
system uses `Res<UiPipeline>`, you will need to add an ordering like:

```rust
render_app.add_systems(RenderStartup, init_my_resource.after(init_ui_pipeline));
```

### `GatedReader` and `GatedOpener` are now private.

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18473]) }}

The `GatedReader` and `GatedOpener` for `bevy_asset` have been made private. These were really only
for testing, but were being compiled even in release builds. Now they are guarded by `#[cfg(test)]`!

If you were using this in your own tests, you could fork the `GatedReader` (it still exists in the
Bevy repo!) into your own code, or write your own version (if more useful to you).

### Updated `glam`, `rand` and `getrandom` versions with new failures when building for web

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18047]) }}

We've upgraded `glam` and the other math crates (`encase`, `hexasphere`) that move in lockstep to the latest versions.
With newer versions of `glam` & `encase`, the updated versions don't seem to have introduced breakages, though as always, best to consult their docs [1](https://docs.rs/glam/latest/glam/) [2](https://docs.rs/encase/0.11.0/encase/) for any changes.

This has also upgraded the version of `rand` and `getrandom` that Bevy relies on.
`rand` changes are more extensive, with changes such as `thread_rng()` -> `rng()`, `from_entropy()` -> `from_os_rng()`, and so forth. `RngCore` is now split into infallible `RngCore` and fallible `TryRngCore`, and the `distributions` module has been renamed to `distr`. Most of this affects only internals, and doesn't directly affect Bevy's APIs. For the full set of changes, see `rand` [migration notes](https://rust-random.github.io/book/update-0.9.html).

`getrandom` is also updated, and will require additional configuration when building Bevy for WASM/web browsers.
**This will affect you even if you are not using `rand` or `getrandom` directly,**
as `glam` (and thus `bevy_math`) will pull it in.

You may encounter an error like:

```toml
error: the wasm*-unknown-unknown targets are not supported by default;
to enable support, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

[dependencies]
getrandom = { version = "0.3", features = ["wasm_js"] }
```

This is due to a breaking change in how `getrandom` handles entropy generation.
For security reasons, this is no longer specified via feature flags,
as any crate in your dependency tree could quietly enable additional entropy sources.

Quoting from the `getrandom` docs on [WebAssembly support in `getrandom`](https://github.com/rust-random/getrandom?tab=readme-ov-file#opt-in-backends) [2](https://github.com/rust-random/getrandom?tab=readme-ov-file#webassembly-support):

> To enable getrandom's functionality on wasm32-unknown-unknown using the Web Crypto methods described above via wasm-bindgen, do both of the following:
>
> 1. Use the wasm_js feature flag, i.e. getrandom = { version = "0.3", features = ["wasm_js"] }. On its own, this only makes the backend available. (As a side effect this will make your Cargo.lock significantly larger if you are not already using wasm-bindgen, but otherwise enabling this feature is harmless.)
> 2. Set RUSTFLAGS='--cfg getrandom_backend="wasm_js"' (see above).

Note that if you were previously setting the [`RUSTFLAGS` environment variable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html)
for any reason, this will override any previous settings: you need to add this to your existing list instead.

If you were using the community-provided [Bevy CLI](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli) to easily create builds of your game for different platforms (including web),
make sure to update to v0.1.0-alpha.2 or later, which will [automatically configure `RUSTFLAGS` for you](https://thebevyflock.github.io/bevy_cli/cli/web/getrandom.html).

### `OverflowClipBox`'s default is now `PaddingBox`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18935]) }}

The default variant for `OverflowClipBox` is now `PaddingBox`.
The default value for `OverflowClipMargin::visual_box` is now `OverflowClipBox::PaddingBox`.

### `Event` trait split / Rename

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19647]) }}

"Buffered events" (things sent/read using `EventWriter` / `EventReader`) are now no longer referred to as "events", in the interest of conceptual clarity and learn-ability (see the release notes for rationale). "Event" as a concept (and the `Event` trait) are now used solely for "observable events". "Buffered events" are now known as "messages" and use the `Message` trait. `EventWriter`, `EventReader`, and `Events<E>`, are now known as `MessageWriter`, `MessageReader`, and `Messages<M>`. Types can be _both_ "messages" and "events" by deriving both `Message` and `Event`, but we expect most types to only be used in one context or the other.

### Deprecated Simple Executor

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18753]) }}

Bevy has deprecated `SimpleExecutor`, one of the `SystemExecutor`s in Bevy alongside `SingleThreadedExecutor` and `MultiThreadedExecutor` (which aren't going anywhere any time soon).

The `SimpleExecutor` leaves performance on the table compared to the other executors in favor of simplicity.
Specifically, `SimpleExecutor` applies any commands a system produces right after it finishes, so every system starts with a clean `World` with no pending commands.
As a result, the default `SimpleExecutor` runs all systems in the order they are added to the schedule, though more ordering constraints can be applied, like `before`, `after`, `chain`, etc.
In other executors, these ordering onstraints also inform the executor exactly where to apply commands.
For example, if system `A` produces commands and runs `before` system `B`, `A`'s commands will be applied before `B` starts.
However, the `before` ordering is implicit in `SimpleExecutor` if `A` is added to the schedule before `B`.

The dueling behavior between ordering systems based on when they were added to a schedule as opposed to using ordering constraints is difficult to maintain and can be confusing, especially for new users.
But, if you have a strong preference for the existing behavior of `SimpleExecutor`, please make an issue and we can discuss your needs.

If you were using `SimpleExecutor`, consider upgrading to `SingleThreadedExecutor` instead, or try `MultiThreadedExecutor` if it fits the schedule.
The `MultiThreadedExecutor` is great at large schedules and async heavy work, and the `SingleThreadedExecutor` is good at smaller schedules or schedules that have fewer parallelizable systems.
So what was `SimpleExecutor` good at? Not much. That's why we plan to remove it. Removing it will reduce some maintenance and consistency burdens, allowing us to focus on more exciting features!

When migrating, you might uncover bugs where one system depends on another's commands but is not ordered to reflect that.
These bugs can be fixed by making those implicit orderings explicit via constraints like `before`, `after`, `chain`, etc.
If finding all of those implicit but necessary orderings is unrealistic, `chain` can also be used to mimic the behavior of the `SimpleExecutor`.
Again, if you run into trouble migrating, feel free to open an issue!

### `ReflectAsset` now uses `UntypedAssetId` instead of `UntypedHandle`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19606]) }}

Previously, `ReflectAsset` methods all required having `UntypedHandle`. The only way to get an
`UntypedHandle` through this API was with `ReflectAsset::add`. `ReflectAsset::ids` was not very
useful in this regard.

Now, all methods have been changed to accept `impl Into<UntypedAssetId>`, which matches our regular
`Assets<T>` API. This means you may need to change how you are calling these methods.

For example, if your code previously looked like:

```rust
let my_handle: UntypedHandle;
let my_asset = reflect_asset.get_mut(world, my_handle).unwrap();
```

You can migrate it to:

```rust
let my_handle: UntypedHandle;
let my_asset = reflect_asset.get_mut(world, &my_handle).unwrap();
```

### Replaced `TextFont` constructor methods with `From` impls

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20335, 20450]) }}

The `TextFont::from_font` and `TextFont::from_line_height` constructor methods have been removed in favor of `From` trait implementations.

```rust
// 0.16
let text_font = TextFont::from_font(font_handle);
let text_font = TextFont::from_line_height(line_height);

// 0.17
let text_font = TextFont::from(font_handle);
let text_font = TextFont::from(line_height);
```

### `VectorSpace` implementations

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19194]) }}

Previously, implementing `VectorSpace` for a type required your type to use or at least interface with `f32`. This made implementing `VectorSpace` for double-precision types (like `DVec3`) less meaningful and useful, requiring lots of casting. `VectorSpace` has a new required associated type `Scalar` that's bounded by a new trait `ScalarField`. `bevy_math` implements this trait for `f64` and `f32` out of the box, and `VectorSpace` is now implemented for `DVec[N]` types.

If you manually implemented `VectorSpace` for any type, you'll need to implement `Scalar` for it. If you were working with single-precision floating-point types and you want the exact behavior from before, set it to `f32`.

### Improve error when using `run_system` command with a `SystemId` of wrong type

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19011]) }}

Added a new error to `RegisteredSystemError` to inform of use of `run_system` command and its
variants with a `SystemId` of wrong type.

### Extract UI text colors per glyph

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20245]) }}

The UI renderer now extracts text colors per glyph and transforms per text section.
`color: LinearRgba` and `translation: Vec2` have been added to `ExtractedGlyph`.
The `transform` field has moved from `ExtractedGlyph` and `ExtractedUiNode` to `ExtractedUiItem`.
The `rect` field has moved from `ExtractedUiNode` to `ExtractedUiItem`.

### TextureFormat::pixel_size now returns a Result

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20574]) }}

The `TextureFormat::pixel_size()` method now returns a `Result<usize, TextureAccessError>` instead of `usize`.

This change was made because not all texture formats have a well-defined pixel size (e.g. compressed formats). Previously, calling this method on such formats could lead to runtime panics. The new return type makes the API safer and more explicit about this possibility.

To migrate your code, you will need to handle the `Result` returned by `pixel_size()`.

### `Entities` API changes

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19350, 19433]) }}

`Entities::flush` now also asks for metadata about the flush operation
that will be stored for the flushed entities. For the source location,
`MaybeLocation::caller()` can be used; the tick should be retrieved
from the world.

Additionally, flush now gives `&mut EntityIdLocation` instead of `&mut EntityLocation` access.
`EntityIdLocation` is an alias for `Option<EntityLocation>`.
This replaces invalid locations with `None`.
It is possible for an `Entity` id to be allocated/reserved but not yet have a location.
This is used in commands for example, and this reality is more transparent with an `Option`.
This extends to other interfaces: `Entities::free` now returns `Option<EntityIdLocation>` instead of `Option<EntityLocation>`.
`Entities::get` remains unchanged, but you can access an `Entity`'s `EntityIdLocation` through the new `Entities::get_id_location`.

### Relationship method set_risky

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19601]) }}

The trait `Relationship` received a new method, `set_risky`. It is used to alter the entity ID of the entity that contains its `RelationshipTarget` counterpart.
This is needed to leave [other data you can store in these components](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/relationship/trait.Relationship.html#derive)
unchanged at operations that reassign the relationship target, for example `EntityCommands::add_related`. Previously this could have caused the
data to be reset to its default value which may not be what you wanted to happen.

Manually overwriting the component is still possible everywhere the full component is inserted:

```rs
#[derive(Component)]
#[relationship(relationship_target = CarOwner)]
struct OwnedCar {
    #[relationship]
    owner: Entity,
    first_owner: Option<Entity>, // None if `owner` is the first one
}

#[derive(Component)]
#[relationship_target(relationship = OwnedCar)]
struct CarOwner(Vec<Entity>);

let mut me_entity_mut = world.entity_mut(me_entity);

// if `car_entity` already contains `OwnedCar`, then the first owner remains unchanged
me_entity_mut.add_one_related::<OwnedCar>(car_entity);

// if `car_entity` already contains `OwnedCar`, then the first owner is overwritten with None here
car_entity_mut.insert(OwnedCar {
    owner: me_entity,
    first_owner: None // I swear it is not stolen officer!
});
```

The new method should not be called by user code as that can invalidate the relationship it had or will have.

If you implement `Relationship` manually (which is strongly discouraged) then this method needs to overwrite the `Entity`
used for the relationship.

### Unified system state flag

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19506]) }}

Now the system have a unified `SystemStateFlags` to represent its different states.

If your code previously looked like this:

```rust
impl System for MyCustomSystem {
    // ...

    fn is_send(&self) -> bool {
        false
    }

    fn is_exclusive(&self) -> bool {
        true
    }

    fn has_deferred(&self) -> bool {
        false
    }

    // ....
}
```

You should migrate it to:

```rust
impl System for MyCustomSystem{
  // ...

  fn flags(&self) -> SystemStateFlags {
    // non-send , exclusive , no deferred
    SystemStateFlags::NON_SEND | SystemStateFlags::EXCLUSIVE
  }

  // ...
}
```

### `DynamicBundle`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20772, 20877]) }}

In order to reduce the stack size taken up by spawning and inserting large bundles, the way the (mostly internal) trait `DynamicBundle` gets called has changed significantly:

```rust
// 0.16
trait DynamicBundle {
    type Effect;

    // hidden in the docs
    fn get_components(self, func: &mut impl FnMut(StorageType, OwningPtr<'_>)) -> Self::Effect;
}

// 0.17
trait DynamicBundle {
    type Effect;

    unsafe fn get_components(ptr: MovingPtr<'_, Self>, func: &mut impl FnMut(StorageType, MovingPtr<'_>));
    unsafe fn apply_effect(ptr: MovingPtr<'_, MaybeUninit<Self>>, entity: &mut EntityWorldMut);
}
```

To prevent unnecessary copies to the stack, `get_components` now takes a `MovingPtr<'_, Self>` instead of `self` by value.

`MovingPtr<T>` is a safe, typed, box-like pointer that owns the data it points to, but not the underlying memory: that means the owner of a `MovingPtr<T>` can freely move parts of the data out and doesn't have to worry about de-allocating memory.
Much like `Box<T>`, `MovingPtr<T>` implements `Deref` and `DerefMut` for easy access to the stored type, when it's safe to do so.
To decompose the value inside of the `MovingPtr<T>` into its fields without copying them to the stack, you can use the `deconstruct_moving_ptr!` macro to give you `MovingPtr<U>`s to each field specified:

```rust
struct MySpecialBundle<A: Bundle, B: Bundle> {
    a: A,
    b: B,
}
let my_ptr: MovingPtr<'_, MySpecialBundle<u32, String>> = ...;
deconstruct_moving_ptr!({
    let MySpecialBundle { a, b } = my_ptr;
});
let a_ptr: MovingPtr<'_, u32> = a;
let b_ptr: MovingPtr<'_, String> = b;
```

Similar to `Box::into_inner`, `MovingPtr<T>` also has a method `MovingPtr::read` for moving the whole value out of the pointer onto the stack:

```rust
let a: u32 = a_ptr.read();
let b: String = b_ptr.read();
```

`apply_effect` is a new method that takes the job of the old `BundleEffect` trait, and gets called once after `get_components` for any `B::Effect: !NoBundleEffect`.
Since `get_components` might have already partially moved out some of the fields of the bundle, `apply_effect` takes a `MovingPtr<'_, MaybeUninit<Self>>` and implementers must make sure not to create any references to fields that are no longer initialized.
Likewise, implementers of `get_components` must take care not to move out fields that will be needed in `apply_effect`. `deconstruct_moving_ptr!` can be used to selectively move out fields, which can then be forgotten with `mem::forget` to be valid for the subsequent call to `apply_effect`.
The associated type `Effect` remains as a vestigial marker to keep track of whether `apply_effect` needs to be called for any `B::Effect: !NoBundleEffect`.

### Exclusive systems may not be used as observers

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19033]) }}

Exclusive systems may no longer be used as observers.
This was never sound, as the engine keeps references alive during observer invocation that would be invalidated by `&mut World` access, but was accidentally allowed.
Instead of `&mut World`, use either `DeferredWorld` if you do not need structural changes, or `Commands` if you do.

### EntityClonerBuilder Split

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19649, 19977]) }}

`EntityClonerBuilder` is now generic and has different methods depending on the generic.

To get the wanted one, `EntityCloner::build` got split too:

- `EntityCloner::build_opt_out` to get `EntityClonerBuilder<OptOut>`
- `EntityCloner::build_opt_in` to get `EntityClonerBuilder<OptIn>`

The first is used to clone all components possible and optionally _opting out_ of some.
The second is used to only clone components as specified by _opting in_ for them.

```rs
// 0.16
let mut builder = EntityCloner.build(&mut world);
builder.allow_all().deny::<ComponentThatShouldNotBeCloned>();
builder.clone_entity(source_entity, target_entity);

let mut builder = EntityCloner.build(&mut world);
builder.deny_all().allow::<ComponentThatShouldBeCloned>();
builder.clone_entity(source_entity, target_entity);

// 0.17
let mut builder = EntityCloner.build_opt_out(&mut world);
builder.deny::<ComponentThatShouldNotBeCloned>();
builder.clone_entity(source_entity, target_entity);

let mut builder = EntityCloner.build_opt_in(&mut world);
builder.allow::<ComponentThatShouldBeCloned>();
builder.clone_entity(source_entity, target_entity);
```

Still, using `EntityClonerBuilder::finish` will return a non-generic `EntityCloner`.
This change is done because the behavior of the two is too different to share the same struct and same methods and mixing them caused bugs.

The methods of the two builder types are different to 0.16 and to each other now:

#### Opt-Out variant

- Still offers variants of the `deny` methods.
- No longer offers `allow` methods, you need to be exact with denying components.
- Offers now the `insert_mode` method to configure if components are cloned if they already exist at the target.
- Required components of denied components are no longer considered. Denying `A`, which requires `B`, does not imply `B` alone would not be useful at the target. So if you do not want to clone `B` too, you need to deny it explicitly. This also means there is no `without_required_components` method anymore as that would be redundant.
- It is now the other way around: Denying `A`, which is required _by_ `C`, will now also deny `C`. This can be bypassed with the new `without_required_by_components` method.

#### Opt-In variant

- Still offers variants of the `allow` methods.
- No longer offers `deny` methods, you need to be exact with allowing components.
- Offers now `allow_if_new` method variants that only clone this component if the target does not contain it. If it does, required components of it will also not be cloned, except those that are also required by one that is actually cloned.
- Still offers the `without_required_components` method.

#### Common methods

All other methods `EntityClonerBuilder` had in 0.16 are still available for both variants:

- `with_default_clone_fn`
- `move_components`
- `clone_behavior` variants
- `linked_cloning`

#### Unified id filtering

Previously `EntityClonerBuilder` supported filtering by 2 types of ids: `ComponentId` and `TypeId`, the functions taking in `IntoIterator` for them.
Since now `EntityClonerBuilder` supports filtering by `BundleId` as well, the number of method variations would become a bit too unwieldy.
Instead, all id filtering methods were unified into generic `deny_by_ids/allow_by_ids(_if_new)` methods, which allow to filter components by
`TypeId`, `ComponentId`, `BundleId` and their `IntoIterator` variations.

### Changes to type registration for reflection

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[15030, 20435, 20893]) }}

Calling `.register_type` has long been a nuisance for Bevy users: both library authors and end users.
This step was previously required in order to register reflected type information in the `TypeRegistry`.

In Bevy 0.17 however, types which implement `Reflect` are now automatically registered, with the help of some compiler magic.
You should be able to remove almost all of your `register_type` calls.
This comes with a few caveats however:

1. Automatic type registration is gated by feature flags.
2. There are two approaches to do this: one has incomplete platform support, while the other relies on a specific project structure.
3. Generic types are not automatically registered, and must still be manually registered.

In order for Bevy to automatically register your types, you need to turn on the `reflect_auto_register` feature, or the fallback `reflect_auto_register_static`.
The `reflect_auto_register` feature is part of Bevy's default features, and can be overridden by the `reflect_auto_register_static` feature flag.
Be aware that the `reflect_auto_register_static` feature comes with some caveats for project structure: check the docs for [load_type_registrations!](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.17.0-rc.1/bevy/reflect/macro.load_type_registrations.html) and follow the [`auto_register_static` example](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/examples/reflection/auto_register_static).

We recommend that you:

1. Enable `reflect_auto_register` in your application code, CI and in examples/tests. You can enable `bevy` features for tests only by adding a matching copy of `bevy` to `dev-dependencies` with the needed features enabled.
2. Do not enable the `reflect_auto_register` feature or the fallback `reflect_auto_register_static` in your library code.
3. As a library author, you can safely remove all non-generic `.register_type` calls.
4. As a user, if you run into an unregistered generic type with the correct feature enabled, file a bug with the project that defined the offending type, and workaround it by calling `.register_type` manually.
5. If you are on an unsupported platform but need reflection support, try the `reflect_autoregister_static` feature, and consider working upstream to add support for your platform in `inventory`. As a last resort, you can still manually register all of the needed types in your application code.

### Composable Specialization

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[17373]) }}

The existing pipeline specialization APIs (`SpecializedRenderPipeline` etc.) have
been replaced with a single `Specializer` trait and `Variants` collection:

```rust
pub trait Specializer<T: Specializable>: Send + Sync + 'static {
    type Key: SpecializerKey;
    fn specialize(
        &self,
        key: Self::Key,
        descriptor: &mut T::Descriptor,
    ) -> Result<Canonical<Self::Key>, BevyError>;
}

pub struct Variants<T: Specializable, S: Specializer<T>>{ ... };
```

For more info on specialization, see the docs for `bevy_render::render_resources::Specializer`

#### Mutation and Base Descriptors

The main difference between the old and new trait is that instead of
_producing_ a pipeline descriptor, `Specializer`s _mutate_ existing descriptors
based on a key. As such, `Variants::new` takes in a "base descriptor"
to act as the template from which the specializer creates pipeline variants.

When migrating, the "static" parts of the pipeline (that don't depend
on the key) should become part of the base descriptor, while the specializer
itself should only change the parts demanded by the key. In the full example
below, instead of creating the entire pipeline descriptor the specializer
only changes the msaa sample count and the bind group layout.

#### Composing Specializers

`Specializer`s can also be _composed_ with the included derive macro to combine
their effects! This is a great way to encapsulate and reuse specialization logic,
though the rest of this guide will focus on migrating "standalone" specializers.

```rust
pub struct MsaaSpecializer {...}
impl Specialize<RenderPipeline> for MsaaSpecializer {...}

pub struct MeshLayoutSpecializer {...}
impl Specialize<RenderPipeline> for MeshLayoutSpecializer {...}

#[derive(Specializer)]
#[specialize(RenderPipeline)]
pub struct MySpecializer {
    msaa: MsaaSpecializer,
    mesh_layout: MeshLayoutSpecializer,
}
```

#### Misc Changes

The analogue of `SpecializedRenderPipelines`, `Variants`, is no longer a
Bevy `Resource`. Instead, the cache should be stored in a user-created `Resource`
(shown below) or even in a `Component` depending on the use case.

#### Full Migration Example

Before:

```rust
#[derive(Resource)]
pub struct MyPipeline {
    layout: BindGroupLayout,
    layout_msaa: BindGroupLayout,
    vertex: Handle<Shader>,
    fragment: Handle<Shader>,
}

// before
#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub struct MyPipelineKey {
    msaa: Msaa,
}

impl FromWorld for MyPipeline {
    fn from_world(world: &mut World) -> Self {
        let render_device = world.resource::<RenderDevice>();
        let asset_server = world.resource::<AssetServer>();

        let layout = render_device.create_bind_group_layout(...);
        let layout_msaa = render_device.create_bind_group_layout(...);

        let vertex = asset_server.load("vertex.wgsl");
        let fragment = asset_server.load("fragment.wgsl");

        Self {
            layout,
            layout_msaa,
            vertex,
            fragment,
        }
    }
}

impl SpecializedRenderPipeline for MyPipeline {
    type Key = MyPipelineKey;

    fn specialize(&self, key: Self::Key) -> RenderPipelineDescriptor {
        RenderPipelineDescriptor {
            label: Some("my_pipeline".into()),
            layout: vec![
                if key.msaa.samples() > 1 {
                    self.layout_msaa.clone()
                } else {
                    self.layout.clone()
                }
            ],
            vertex: VertexState {
                shader: self.vertex.clone(),
                ..default()
            },
            multisample: MultisampleState {
                count: key.msaa.samples(),
                ..default()
            },
            fragment: Some(FragmentState {
                shader: self.fragment.clone(),
                targets: vec![Some(ColorTargetState {
                    format: TextureFormat::Rgba8Unorm,
                    blend: None,
                    write_mask: ColorWrites::all(),
                })],
                ..default()
            }),
            ..default()
        },
    }
}

render_app
    .init_resource::<MyPipeline>();
    .init_resource::<SpecializedRenderPipelines<MySpecializer>>();
```

After:

```rust
#[derive(Resource)]
pub struct MyPipeline {
    // the base_descriptor and specializer each hold onto the static
    // wgpu resources (layout, shader handles), so we don't need
    // explicit fields for them here. However, real-world cases
    // may still need to expose them as fields to create bind groups
    // from, for example.
    variants: Variants<RenderPipeline, MySpecializer>,
}

pub struct MySpecializer {
    layout: BindGroupLayout,
    layout_msaa: BindGroupLayout,
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, SpecializerKey)]
pub struct MyPipelineKey {
    msaa: Msaa,
}

impl FromWorld for MyPipeline {
    fn from_world(world: &mut World) -> Self {
        let render_device = world.resource::<RenderDevice>();
        let asset_server = world.resource::<AssetServer>();

        let layout = render_device.create_bind_group_layout(...);
        let layout_msaa = render_device.create_bind_group_layout(...);

        let vertex = asset_server.load("vertex.wgsl");
        let fragment = asset_server.load("fragment.wgsl");

        let base_descriptor = RenderPipelineDescriptor {
            label: Some("my_pipeline".into()),

            ..default()
        },

        let variants = Variants::new(
            MySpecializer {
                layout: layout.clone(),
                layout_msaa: layout_msaa.clone(),
            },
            base_descriptor,
        );

        Self { variants }
    }
}

    ) -> Result<Canonical<Self::Key>, BevyError> {
        descriptor.multisample.count = key.msaa.samples();

        let layout = if key.msaa.samples() > 1 {
            self.layout_msaa.clone()
        } else {
            self.layout.clone()
        };

        descriptor.set_layout(0, layout);

        Ok(key)
    }
}

render_app.init_resource::<MyPipeline>();

```

### `Entry` enum is now `ComponentEntry`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19517]) }}

The `Entry` enum in `bevy::ecs::world` has been renamed to `ComponentEntry`, to avoid name clashes with `hash_map`, `hash_table` and `hash_set` `Entry` types.

Correspondingly, the nested `OccupiedEntry` and `VacantEntry` enums have been renamed to `OccupiedComponentEntry` and `VacantComponentEntry`.

### State-scoped entities are now always enabled implicitly

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19354, 20883]) }}

State scoped entities is now always enabled, and as a consequence, `app.enable_state_scoped_entities::<State>()` is no longer needed.
It has been marked as deprecated and does nothing when called.

The attribute `#[states(scoped_entities)]` has been removed. You can safely remove it from your code without replacement.

### Required components refactor

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20110]) }}

The required components feature has been reworked to be more consistent around the priority of the required components and fix some soundness issues. In particular:

- the priority of required components will now always follow a priority given by the depth-first/preorder traversal of the dependency tree. This was mostly the case before with a couple of exceptions that we are now fixing:
  - when deriving the `Component` trait, sometimes required components at depth 1 had priority over components at depth 2 even if they came after in the depth-first ordering;
  - registering runtime required components followed a breadth-first ordering and used the wrong inheritance depth for derived required components.
- uses of the inheritance depth were removed from the `RequiredComponent` struct and from the methods for registering runtime required components, as it's not unused for the depth-first ordering;
- `Component::register_required_components`, `RequiredComponents::register` and `RequiredComponents::register_by_id` are now `unsafe`;
- `RequiredComponentConstructor`'s only field is now private for safety reasons.

The `Component::register_required_components` method has also changed signature. It now takes the `ComponentId` of the component currently being registered and a single other parameter `RequiredComponentsRegistrator` which combines the old `components` and `required_components` parameters, since exposing both of them was unsound. As previously discussed the `inheritance_depth` is now useless and has been removed, while the `recursion_check_stack` has been moved into `ComponentsRegistrator` and will be handled automatically.

### view_transformations.wgsl deprecated in favor of view.wgsl

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20313]) }}

All functions in view_transformations.wgsl have been replaced and deprecated.

To migrate, a straight-forward copy-paste inlining of the deprecated function's new body suffices, as they all now call the new api internally.

For example, if you had before:

```wgsl
#import bevy_pbr::view_transformations

let world_pos = view_transformations::position_view_to_world(view_pos);
```

Now it would be:

```wgsl
#import bevy_render::view

let world_pos = view::position_view_to_world(view_pos, view_bindings::view.world_from_view);
```

This was done to make it possible to pass in custom view bindings, and allow code reuse.

`view_transformations.wgsl` will be deleted in 0.18.

### Replace `Gilrs`, `AccessKitAdapters`, and `WinitWindows` non-send resources

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18386, 17730, 19575]) }}

We are [working](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1332109626962874468) to move `!Send` data out of the ECS, in order to simplify internal implementation,
reduce the risk of soundness problems and unblock features such as resources-as-entities and improved scheduling.

For now, the API for user-provided `NonSend` types is unchanged, but we are considering forcing
all users to migrate to a solution similar to the one discussed below.

#### First-party `NonSend` Resources Replaced

Internally, we have replaced the following resources:

- `Gilrs` - _For wasm32 only, other platforms are unchanged -_ Replaced with `bevy_gilrs::GILRS`
- `WinitWindows` - Replaced with `bevy_winit::WINIT_WINDOWS`
- `AccessKitAdapters` - Replaced with `bevy_winit::ACCESS_KIT_ADAPTERS`

Each of these are now using `thread_local`s to store the data and are temporary solutions to storing `!Send` data. Even though `thread_local`s are thread safe, they should not be accessed from other threads. If they are accessed from other threads, the data will be uninitialized in each non-main thread, which isn't very useful.

Here is an example of how the data can now be accessed. This example will use `WINIT_WINDOWS` as an example, but the same technique can be applied to the others:

##### Immutable Access

```rust
use bevy_winit::WINIT_WINDOWS;

...

WINIT_WINDOWS.with_borrow(|winit_windows| {
    // do things with `winit_windows`
});
```

##### Mutable Access

```rust
use bevy_winit::WINIT_WINDOWS;

...

WINIT_WINDOWS.with_borrow_mut(|winit_windows| {
    // do things with `winit_windows`
});
```

If a borrow is attempted while the data is borrowed elsewhere, the method will panic.

#### NonSend Systems

The use of a `NonSend` or `NonSendMut` resource in a system would force the system to execute on the main thread.
However, when using the new `thread_local` pattern, we still need to prevent systems from running on non-main threads.
To do this, you can now use `bevy_ecs::system::NonSendMarker` as a system parameter:

```rust
use bevy_ecs::system::NonSendMarker;

fn my_system(
    _non_send_marker: NonSendMarker,
) {
    ACCESS_KIT_ADAPTERS.with_borrow_mut(|adapters| {
        // do things with adapters
    });
}
```

To prevent a panic, if any of the `!Send` resource replacements mentioned in this document are used in a system, the system should _always_ be marked as `!Send` with `bevy_ecs::system::NonSendMarker`.

### `ComponentsRegistrator` no longer implements `DerefMut`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[14791, 15458, 15269]) }}

`ComponentsRegistrator` no longer implements `DerefMut<Target = Components>`, meaning you won't be able to get a `&mut Components` from it. The only two methods on `Components` that took `&mut self` (`any_queued_mut` and `num_queued_mut`) have been reimplemented on `ComponentsRegistrator`, meaning you won't need to migrate them. Other usages of `&mut Components` were unsupported.

### Query items can borrow from query state

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[15396, 19720]) }}

The `QueryData::Item` associated type and the `QueryItem` and `ROQueryItem` type aliases now have an additional lifetime parameter corresponding to the `'s` lifetime in `Query`.
The `QueryData::fetch()` and `QueryFilter::filter_fetch()` methods have a new parameter taking a `&'s WorldQuery::State`.
Manual implementations of `WorldQuery` and `QueryData` will need to update the method signatures to include the new lifetimes.
Other uses of the types will need to be updated to include a lifetime parameter, although it can usually be passed as `'_`.
In particular, `ROQueryItem` is used when implementing `RenderCommand`.

Before:

```rust
// 0.16
fn render<'w>(
    item: &P,
    view: ROQueryItem<'w, Self::ViewQuery>,
    entity: Option<ROQueryItem<'w, Self::ItemQuery>>,
    param: SystemParamItem<'w, '_, Self::Param>,
    pass: &mut TrackedRenderPass<'w>,
) -> RenderCommandResult;

// 0.17
fn render<'w>(
    item: &P,
    view: ROQueryItem<'w, '_, Self::ViewQuery>,
    entity: Option<ROQueryItem<'w, '_, Self::ItemQuery>>,
    param: SystemParamItem<'w, '_, Self::Param>,
    pass: &mut TrackedRenderPass<'w>,
) -> RenderCommandResult;
```

---

Methods on `QueryState` that take `&mut self` may now result in conflicting borrows if the query items capture the lifetime of the mutable reference.
This affects `get()`, `iter()`, and others.
To fix the errors, first call `QueryState::update_archetypes()`, and then replace a call `state.foo(world, param)` with `state.query_manual(world).foo_inner(param)`.
Alternately, you may be able to restructure the code to call `state.query(world)` once and then make multiple calls using the `Query`.

```rust
let mut state: QueryState<_, _> = ...;

// 0.16
let d1 = state.get(world, e1);
let d2 = state.get(world, e2); // Error: cannot borrow `state` as mutable more than once at a time

println!("{d1:?}");
println!("{d2:?}");

// 0.17
state.update_archetypes(world);
let d1 = state.get_manual(world, e1);
let d2 = state.get_manual(world, e2);
// OR
state.update_archetypes(world);
let d1 = state.query_manual(world).get_inner(e1);
let d2 = state.query_manual(world).get_inner(e2);
// OR
let query = state.query(world);
let d1 = query.get_inner(e1);
let d1 = query.get_inner(e2);

println!("{d1:?}");
println!("{d2:?}");
```

### Non-generic `Access`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20288]) }}

Now that `archetype_component_id` has been removed,
`Access`, `AccessFilters`, `FilteredAccess`, and `FilteredAccessSet`
were only ever parameterized by `ComponentId`.
To simplify use of those types, the generic parameter has been removed.
Remove the `<Component>` generic from any use of those types.

```rust
// 0.16
fn update_component_access(state: &Self::State, access: &mut FilteredAccess<ComponentId>) {}
// 0.17
fn update_component_access(state: &Self::State, access: &mut FilteredAccess) {}
```

### Component lifecycle reorganization

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19543]) }}

To improve documentation, discoverability and internal organization, we've gathered all of the component lifecycle-related code we could and moved it into a dedicated `lifecycle` module.

The lifecycle / observer types (`Add`, `Insert`, `Remove`, `Replace`, `Despawn`) have been moved from the `bevy_ecs::world` to `bevy_ecs::lifecycle`.

The same move has been done for the more internal (but public) `ComponentId` constants: `ADD`, `INSERT`, `REMOVE`, `REPLACE`, `DESPAWN`.

The code for hooks (`HookContext`, `ComponentHook`, `ComponentHooks`) has been extracted from the very long `bevy_ecs::components` module, and now lives in the `bevy_ecs::lifecycle` module.

The `RemovedComponents` `SystemParam`, along with the public `RemovedIter`, `RemovedIterWithId` and `RemovedComponentEvents` have also been moved into this module as they serve a similar role. All references to `bevy_ecs::removal_detection` can be replaced with `bevy_ecs::lifecycle`.

### Polylines and Polygons are no longer const-generic

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20250]) }}

`Polyline2d`, `Polyline3d`, `Polygon`, and `ConvexPolygon` are no longer const-generic and now implement `Meshable` for
direct mesh generation. These types now use `Vec` instead of arrays internally and will therefore allocate and are no
longer `no_std` compatible.

If you need these types to be `no_std` and/or const-generic, please file an issue explaining your use case
and we can consider creating fixed side-count polygon/polyline variants.

### Changes to the default error handler mechanism

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18810]) }}

We've improved the implementation of Bevy's default error handling.
The performance overhead has been reduced, and as a result it is always enabled.
The `configurable_error_handler` feature no longer exists: simply remove it from your list of enabled features.

Additionally, worlds can now have different default error handlers, so there is no longer a truly global handler.

Replace uses of `GLOBAL_ERROR_HANDLER` with `App::set_error_handler(handler)`.
For worlds that do not directly belong to an `App`/`SubApp`,
insert the `DefaultErrorHandler(handler)` resource.

### Removed Deprecated Batch Spawning Methods

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18148]) }}

The following deprecated functions have been removed:

- `Commands::insert_or_spawn_batch`
- `World::insert_or_spawn_batch`
- `World::insert_or_spawn_batch_with_caller`

These functions, when used incorrectly, could cause major performance problems and generally violated the privacy of the ECS internals in ways
that the Bevy maintainers were not prepared to support long-term.
They were deprecated in 0.16 due to their potential for misuse, as the retained render world removed Bevy's own uses of these methods.

Instead of allocating entities with specific identifiers, consider one of the following:

1. Instead of despawning entities, insert the `Disabled` component, and instead of respawning them at particular ids, use `try_insert_batch` or `insert_batch` and remove `Disabled`.

2. Instead of giving special meaning to an entity id, simply use `spawn_batch` and ensure entity references are valid when despawning.

3. Use your own stable identifier and a map to `Entity` identifiers, with the help of the `EntityMapper` trait.

### Stop storing access in systems

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19496, 19477]) }}

Bevy used to store component access in all systems,
even though it was only used for top-level systems in schedules.
To reduce memory usage, the component access is now stored in the schedule instead.

The trait methods `System::component_access` and `System::component_access_set` have been removed.
Instead, the access is returned from `System::initialize`.
If you were implementing `System` manually, the `initialize` method should return the access instead of storing it.
If you were calling `component_access` or `component_access_set` on a system that you initialized yourself,
you will need to store the access yourself.

```rust
let system = IntoSystem::into_system(your_system);
// 0.16
system.initialize(&mut world);
let access = system.component_access();
// 0.17
let component_access_set = system.initialize(&mut world);
let access = component_access_set.combined_access();
```

`SystemMeta` no longer stores `FilteredAccessSet<ComponentId>`.
It is instead passed as a separate parameter when initializing a `SystemParam`.

To better share logic between `SystemParam` and `SystemParamBuilder`,
`SystemParam::init_state` has been split into `init_state`, which creates the state value, and `init_access`, which calculates the access.
`SystemParamBuilder::build` now only creates the state, and `SystemParam::init_access` will be called to calculate the access for built parameters.

If you were implementing `SystemParam` manually, you will need to separate the logic into two methods
and change any uses of `system_meta.component_access_set(_mut)` to the new `component_access_set` parameter.
Note that `init_state` no longer has access to `SystemMeta` or `component_access_set`, and `init_access` only has `&state`, so the state can no longer depend on the system.

If you were calling `init_state` manually, you will need to call `init_access` afterwards.

```rust
// 0.16
let param_state = P::init_state(world, &mut meta);
// 0.17
let param_state = P::init_state(world);
let mut component_access_set = FilteredAccessSet::new();
P::init_access(&param_state, &mut meta, &mut component_access_set, world);
```

### New `zstd` backend

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19793]) }}

A more performant zstd backend has been added for texture decompression. To enable it, disable default-features and enable feature "zstd_c".
If you have default-features disabled and use functionality that requires zstd decompression ("tonemapping_luts" or "ktx2"), you must choose a zstd implementation with one of the following feature flags: "zstd_c" (faster) or "zstd_rust" (safer)

#### Migration Guide

If you previously used the `zstd` feature explicitly, it has been renamed to `zstd_rust`:

```toml
# 0.16
[dependencies]
bevy = { version = "0.16", features = ["zstd"] }

# 0.17 - Use the safe Rust implementation:
[dependencies]
bevy = { version = "0.17", features = ["zstd_rust"] }

# 0.17 - Or use the faster C implementation:
[dependencies]
bevy = { version = "0.17", features = ["zstd_c"] }
```

If you have default-features disabled and use functionality that requires zstd decompression ("tonemapping_luts" or "ktx2"), you must choose a zstd implementation with one of the following feature flags: "zstd_c" (faster) or "zstd_rust" (safer).

### Remove `ArchetypeComponentId`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19143]) }}

Scheduling no longer uses `archetype_component_access` or `ArchetypeComponentId`.
To reduce memory usage and simplify the implementation, all uses of them have been removed.
Since we no longer need to update access before a system runs, `Query` now updates it state when the system runs instead of ahead of time.

`SystemParam::validate_param` now takes `&mut Self::State` instead of `&Self::State` so that queries can update their state during validation.

The trait methods `System::update_archetype_component_access` and `SystemParam::new_archetype` have been removed.
They are no longer necessary, so calls to them can be removed.
If you were implementing the traits manually, move any logic from those methods into `System::validate_param_unsafe`, `System::run_unsafe`, `SystemParam::validate_param`, or `SystemParam::get_param`, which can no longer rely on `update_archetype_component_access` being called first.

The following methods on `SystemState` have been deprecated:

- `update_archetypes` - Remove calls, as they no longer do anything
- `update_archetypes_unsafe_world_cell` - Remove calls, as they no longer do anything
- `get_manual` - Replace with `get`, as there is no longer a difference
- `get_manual_mut` - Replace with `get_mut`, as there is no longer a difference
- `get_unchecked_mut` - Replace with `get_unchecked`, as there is no longer a difference

### RenderTarget error handling

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20503]) }}

`NormalizedRenderTargetExt::get_render_target_info` now returns a `Result`,
with the `Err` variant indicating which render target (image, window, etc)
failed to load its metadata.

This should mostly be treated as a hard error, since it indicates the rendering
state of the app is broken.

### Renamed BRP methods

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19377]) }}

Most Bevy Remote Protocol methods have been renamed to be more explicit.
The word `destroy` has also been replaced with `despawn` to match the rest of the engine.

| Old                    | New                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `bevy/query`           | `world.query`                 |
| `bevy/spawn`           | `world.spawn_entity`          |
| `bevy/destroy`         | `world.despawn_entity`        |
| `bevy/reparent`        | `world.reparent_entities`     |
| `bevy/get`             | `world.get_components`        |
| `bevy/insert`          | `world.insert_components`     |
| `bevy/remove`          | `world.remove_components`     |
| `bevy/list`            | `world.list_components`       |

### TAA is no longer experimental

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18349]) }}

TAA is no longer experimental.

`TemporalAntiAliasPlugin` no longer needs to be added to your app to use TAA. It is now part of `DefaultPlugins`, via `AntiAliasPlugin`.

As part of this change, the import paths for `TemporalAntiAliasNode`, `TemporalAntiAliasing` and `TemporalAntiAliasPlugin` have changed from `bevy::anti_alias::experimental::taa` to `bevy::anti_alias::taa`: if you want to add `TemporalAntiAliasing` to a Camera, you can now find it at `bevy::anti_alias::taa::TemporalAntiAliasing`.

`TemporalAntiAliasing` now uses `MipBias` as a required component in the main world, instead of overriding it manually in the render world.

### `TextShadow` has been moved to `bevy::ui::widget::text`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[]) }}

`TextShadow` has been moved to `bevy::ui::widget::text`.

### Remove `Bundle::register_required_components`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19967]) }}

This method was effectively dead-code as it was never used by the ECS to compute required components, hence it was removed. if you were overriding its implementation you can just remove it, as it never did anything. If you were using it in any other way, please open an issue.

### Observer / Event API Changes

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20731, 19440, 19596]) }}

The observer "trigger" API has changed a bit to improve clarity and type-safety.

```rust
// Old
commands.add_observer(|trigger: Trigger<OnAdd, Player>| {
    info!("Spawned player {}", trigger.target());
});

// New
commands.add_observer(|add: On<Add, Player>| {
    info!("Spawned player {}", add.entity);
});
```

The `Trigger` type used inside observers has been renamed to `On` to encourage developers to think about this parameter _as_ the event. We also recommend naming the variable after the event type (ex: `add`).

To reduce repetition and improve readability, the `OnAdd`, `OnInsert`, `OnReplace`, `OnRemove`, and `OnDespawn`
observer events have also been renamed to `Add`, `Insert`, `Replace`, `Remove`, and `Despawn` respectively.
In rare cases where the `Add` event conflicts with the `std::ops::Add` trait, you may need to disambiguate,
for example by using `ops::Add` for the trait. We encourage removing the "On" from custom events named `OnX`.

Types implementing `Event` can no longer be triggered from _all contexts. By default `Event` is a "global" / "target-less" event.

Events that target an entity should now derive `EntityEvent`, and they will now store the target entity _on_ the event type, which is accessible via `EntityEvent::event_target`. Additionally, `world.trigger_targets` has been removed in favor of a single `world.trigger` API:

```rust
// Old
#[derive(Event)]
struct Explode;

world.trigger_targets(Explode, entity);

// New
#[derive(EntityEvent)]
struct Explode {
    entity: Entity
}

world.trigger(Explode { entity });
```

Triggering an entity event for multiple entities now requires multiple calls to `trigger`:

```rust
// Old
world.trigger_targets(Explode, [e1, e2]);

// New - Variant 1
world.trigger(Explode { entity: e1 });
world.trigger(Explode { entity: e2 });

// New - Variant 2
for entity in [e1, e2] {
    world.trigger(Explode { entity });
}
```

`On::target()` no longer exists for all event types. Instead, you should prefer accessing the "target entity" field on the events that target entities:

```rust
// Old
commands.add_observer(|trigger: Trigger<Explode>| {
    info!("{} exploded!", trigger.target());
});

// New
commands.add_observer(|explode: On<Explode>| {
    info!("{} exploded!", explode.entity);
    // you can also use `EntityEvent::event_target`, but we encourage
    // using direct field access when possible, for better documentation and clarity.
    info!("{} exploded!", explode.event_target());
});
```

"Propagation functions", such as `On::propagate` are now _only_ available on `On<E>` when `E: EntityEvent<Trigger = PropagateEntityTrigger>`.

Enabling propagation is now down using, which defaults to `ChildOf` propagation:

```rust
#[derive(EntityEvent)]
#[entity_event(propagate)]
struct Click {
    entity: Entity,
}
```

Setting a custom propagation `Traversal` implementation now uses `propagate` instead of `traversal`:

```rust
// OLd
#[derive(Event)]
#[event(traversal = &'static ChildOf)]
struct Click;

// New
#[derive(EntityEvent)]
#[entity_event(propagate = &'static ChildOf)]
struct Click {
    entity: Entity,
}
```

Animation events (used in `AnimationPlayer`) must now derive `AnimationEvent`. Accessing the animation player entity is now done via the `trigger()`.

```rust
// Old
#[derive(Event)]
struct SayMessage(String);

animation.add_event(0.2, SayMessage("hello".to_string()));
world.entity_mut(animation_player).observe(|trigger: Trigger<SayMessage>| {
    println!("played on", trigger.target());
})

// New
#[derive(AnimationEvent)]
struct SayMessage(String);

animation.add_event(0.2, SayMessage("hello".to_string()));
world.entity_mut(animation_player).observe(|say_message: On<SayMessage>| {
    println!("played on", say_message.trigger().animation_player);
})
```

For "component lifecycle events", accessing _all_ of the components that triggered the event has changed:

```rust
// Old
commands.add_observer(|trigger: Trigger<OnAdd, Player>| {
    info!("{}", trigger.components());
});

// New
commands.add_observer(|add: On<Add, Player>| {
    info!("{}", add.trigger().components);
});
```

### Manual Entity Creation and Representation

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18704, 19121]) }}

An entity is made of two parts: and index and a generation. Both have changes:

#### Index

`Entity` no longer stores its index as a plain `u32` but as the new `EntityRow`, which wraps a `NonMaxU32`.
Previously, `Entity::index` could be `u32::MAX`, but that is no longer a valid index.
As a result, `Entity::from_raw` was renamed to `Entity::from_row` and now takes `EntityRow` as a parameter instead of `u32`.
You can use `Entity::from_raw_u32` which is identical to the previous `Entity::from_raw`, except that it now returns `Option` where the result is `None` if `u32::MAX` is passed.

Bevy made this change because it puts a niche in the `EntityRow` type which makes `Option<EntityRow>` half the size of `Option<u32>`.
This is used internally to open up performance improvements to the ECS.

Although you probably shouldn't be making entities manually, it is sometimes useful to do so for tests.
To migrate tests, use:

```diff
- let entity = Entity::from_raw(1);
+ let entity = Entity::from_raw_u32(1).unwrap();
```

If you are creating entities manually in production, don't do that!
Use `Entities::alloc` instead.
But if you must create one manually, either reuse a `EntityRow` you know to be valid by using `Entity::from_row` and `Entity::row`, or handle the error case of `None` returning from `Entity::from_raw_u32(my_index)`.

#### Generation

An entity's generation is no longer a `NonZeroU32`.
Instead, it is an `EntityGeneration`.
Internally, this stores a `u32`, but that might change later.

Working with the generation directly has never been recommended, but it is sometimes useful to do so in tests.
To create a generation do `EntityGeneration::FIRST.after_versions(expected_generation)`.
To use this in tests, do `assert_eq!(entity.generation(), EntityGeneration::FIRST.after_versions(expected_generation))`.

#### Removed Interfaces

The `identifier` module and all its contents have been removed.
These features have been slimmed down and rolled into `Entity`.

This means that where `Result<T, IdentifierError>` was returned, `Option<T>` is now returned.

#### Functionality

It is well documented that both the bit format, serialization, and `Ord` implementations for `Entity` are subject to change between versions.
Those have all changed in this version.

For entity ordering, the order still prioritizes an entity's generation, but after that, it now considers higher index entities less than lower index entities.

The changes to serialization and the bit format are directly related.
Effectively, this means that all serialized and transmuted entities will not work as expected and may crash.
To migrate, invert the lower 32 bits of the 64 representation of the entity, and subtract 1 from the upper bits.
Again, this is still subject to change, and serialized scenes may break between versions.

#### Length Representation

Because the maximum index of an entity is now `NonZeroU32::MAX`, the maximum number of entities (and length of unique entity row collections) is `u32::MAX`.
As a result, a lot of APIs that returned `usize` have been changed to `u32`.

These include:

- `Archetype::len`
- `Table::entity_count`

#### Other kinds of entity rows

Since the `EntityRow` is a `NonMaxU32`, `TableRow` and `ArchetypeRow` have been given the same treatment.
They now wrap a `NonMaxU32`, allowing more performance optimizations.

Additionally, they have been given new, standardized interfaces:

- `fn new(NonMaxU32)`
- `fn index(self) -> usize`
- `fn index_u32(self) -> u32`

The other interfaces for these types have been removed.
Although it's not usually recommended to be creating these types manually, if you run into any issues migrating here, please open an issue.
If all else fails, `TableRow` and `ArchetypeRow` are `repr(transparent)`, allowing careful transmutations.

### RenderTargetInfo's default `scale_factor` has been changed to `1.`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[21082]) }}

The default for `RenderTargetInfo`'s `scale_factor` field is now `1.`.

### `RenderGraphApp` renamed to `RenderGraphExt`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19912]) }}

`RenderGraphApp` has been renamed to `RenderGraphExt`. Rename this for cases where you are
explicitly importing this trait.

### Window Resolution Constructors

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20582]) }}

The `WindowResolution` type stores the width and height as `u32`. Previously, this type could only be constructed with `f32`, which were immediately converted to `u32`.
Now, `WindowResolution` can be constructed with `u32`s directly, and the pointless `f32` conversion has been removed.

```rust
WindowResolution::new(1920.0, 1080.0)
// becomes
WindowResolution::new(1920, 1080)

WindowResolution::new(some_uvec2.x as f32, some_uvec2.y as f32)
// becomes
WindowResolution::from(some_uvec2)

window_resolution: (1920.0, 1080.0).into()
// becomes
window_resolution: (1920, 1080).into()
```

### Specialized UI transform

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[16615]) }}

Bevy UI now uses specialized 2D UI transform components `UiTransform` and `UiGlobalTransform` in place of `Transform` and `GlobalTransform`.

`UiTransform` is a 2D-only equivalent of Transform with a responsive translation in `Val`s. `UiGlobalTransform` newtypes `Affine2` and is updated in `ui_layout_system`.

`Node` now requires `UiTransform` instead of `Transform`. `UiTransform` requires `UiGlobalTransform`.

The `UiTransform` equivalent of the `Transform`:

```rust
Transform {
    translation: Vec3 { x, y, z },
    rotation:Quat::from_rotation_z(radians),
    scale,
}
```

is

```rust
UiTransform {
    translation: Val2::px(x, y),
    rotation: Rot2::from_rotation(radians),
    scale: scale.xy(),
}
```

In previous versions of Bevy `ui_layout_system` would overwrite UI node's `Transform::translation` each frame. `UiTransform`s aren't overwritten and there is no longer any need for systems that cache and rewrite the transform for translated UI elements.

If you were relying on the `z` value of the `GlobalTransform`, this can be derived from `UiStack` instead.

### `CheckChangeTicks` parameter in `System::check_change_tick`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19274, 19600]) }}

`System::check_change_tick` took a `Tick` parameter to update internal ticks. This is needed to keep queried components filtered by their change tick reliably not be matched if their last change or add and the system's last run was very long ago. This is also needed for similar methods involving the system's ticks for the same reason.

This parameter is now a `CheckChangeTicks` type that can be passed to the now-public `Tick::check_tick` in case you maintain these yourself in manual `System` implementations.

If you need a `CheckChangeTicks` value, for example because you call one of the above methods manually, you can observe it. Here is an example where it is used on a schedule stored in a resource, which will pass it on to the `System::check_change_tick` of its systems.

```rs
use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
use bevy_ecs::component::CheckChangeTicks;

#[derive(Resource)]
struct CustomSchedule(Schedule);

let mut world = World::new();
world.add_observer(|check: On<CheckChangeTicks>, mut schedule: ResMut<CustomSchedule>| {
    schedule.0.check_change_ticks(*check);
});
```

The observers are triggered by `World::check_change_ticks` which every schedule calls before running. This method also returns an `Option<CheckChangeTicks>` which is `Some` in case it was time to check the ticks.

### Transform and GlobalTransform::compute_matrix rename

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19643, 19646]) }}

`GlobalTransform::compute_matrix` has been renamed to `GlobalTransform::to_matrix` because it does not compute anything, it simply moves data into a different type.
`Transform::compute_matrix` has been renamed to `Transform::to_matrix` for consistency with `GlobalTransform`.

### Compressed image saver feature

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19789]) }}

The compressed image saver has been gated behind its own dedicated feature flag now. If you were using it, you need to enable the "compressed_image_saver" feature.

### Change filters container of `LogDiagnosticsState` to `HashSet`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19323]) }}

`LogDiagnosticsState`'s filter container and the argument of
`LogDiagnosticPlugin::filtered` is now a `HashSet` rather than a `Vec`.

### `FULLSCREEN_SHADER_HANDLE` replaced with `FullscreenShader`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19426]) }}

`FULLSCREEN_SHADER_HANDLE` and `fullscreen_shader_vertex_state` have been replaced by the
`FullscreenShader` resource. Users of either of these will need to call `FullscreenShader::shader`
or `FullscreenShader::to_vertex_state` respectively. You may need to clone `FullscreenShader` out of
the render world to store an instance that you can use later (e.g., if you are attempting to use the
fullscreen shader inside a `SpecializedRenderPipeline` implementation).

For example, if your previous code looked like this:

```rust
struct MyPipeline {
  some_bind_group: BindGroupLayout,
}

impl FromWorld for MyPipeline {
  fn from_world(render_world: &mut World) -> Self {
    let some_bind_group = /* ... RenderDevice stuff */;
    Self {
      some_bind_group,
    }
  }
}

impl SpecializedRenderPipeline for MyPipeline {
  fn specialize(&self, key: Self::Key) -> RenderPipelineDescriptor {
    RenderPipelineDescriptor {
      vertex: fullscreen_shader_vertex_state(),
      // ... other stuff
    }
  }
}
```

You can migrate your code to:

```rust
struct MyPipeline {
  some_bind_group: BindGroupLayout,
  fullscreen_shader: FullscreenShader,
}

impl FromWorld for MyPipeline {
  fn from_world(render_world: &mut World) -> Self {
    let some_bind_group = /* ... RenderDevice stuff */;
    Self {
      some_bind_group,
      fullscreen_shader: render_world.resource::<FullscreenShader>().clone(),
    }
  }
}

impl SpecializedRenderPipeline for MyPipeline {
  fn specialize(&self, key: Self::Key) -> RenderPipelineDescriptor {
    RenderPipelineDescriptor {
      vertex: self.fullscreen_shader.to_vertex_state(),
      // ... other stuff
    }
  }
}
```

This is just one example. Pipelines may be initialized in different ways, but the primary strategy
is clone out the `FullscreenShader` resource from the render world, and call `to_vertex_state` to
use it as the vertex shader.

### Smooth normals implementation changed

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[18552]) }}

In Bevy 0.16, `Mesh` smooth normal calculation used a triangle area-weighted
algorithm. In 0.17, the area-weighted algorithm was moved to separate methods,
the default implementation was switched to a corner angle-weighted algorithm,
and `Mesh::compute_custom_smooth_normals` was added for other cases.

The angle-weighted method is more suitable for growing or shrinking a mesh along
its vertex normals, such as when generating an outline mesh. It also results in
more expected lighting behavior for some meshes. In most cases, the difference
will be small and no change is needed. However, the new default is somewhat
slower, and does not always produce the result desired by an artist. If you
preferred the lighting in 0.16, or have a significant performance regression,
or needed area-weighted normals for any other reason, you can switch to the
new dedicated area-weighted methods.

```diff
// Only if the new smooth normals algorithm is unsatisfactory:

let mut mesh = Mesh::new(PrimitiveTopology::TriangleList, default())
    .with_inserted_attribute(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_POSITION, positions)
-    .with_computed_smooth_normals();
+    .with_computed_area_weighted_normals;

- mesh.compute_smooth_normals();
+ mesh.compute_area_weighted_normals();
```

As part of this change, the helper functions `face_normal` and
`face_area_normal`, were renamed to `triangle_normal` and `triangle_area_normal`
respectively to better reflect the fact that they do not take an entire
geometric face into account.

```diff
- use bevy::render::mesh::face_normal;
+ use bevy::render::mesh::triangle_normal;
- let normal = face_normal(a, b, c);
+ let normal = triangle_normal(a, b, c);

- use bevy::render::mesh::face_area_normal;
+ use bevy::render::mesh::triangle_area_normal;
- let normal = face_area_normal(a, b, c);
+ let normal = triangle_area_normal(a, b, c);
```

### `SpawnableList`

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[20772, 20877]) }}

In order to reduce the stack size taken up by spawning and inserting large bundles, `SpawnableList` now takes a `MovingPtr<T>` as the self-type for the `spawn` function:

```rust
// 0.16
fn spawn(self, world: &mut World, entity: Entity);

let list = Spawn(my_bundle);
list.spawn(world, entity);

// 0.17
fn spawn(self: MovingPtr<'_, Self>, world: &mut World, entity: Entity);

let list = Spawn(my_bundle);
move_as_ptr!(list);
SpawnableList::spawn(list, world, entity);
```

This change also means that `SpawnableList` must now also be `Sized`!

`MovingPtr<T>` is a safe, typed, box-like pointer that owns the data it points to, but not the underlying memory: that means the owner of a `MovingPtr<T>` can freely move parts of the data out and doesn't have to worry about de-allocating memory.
Much like `Box<T>`, `MovingPtr<T>` implements `Deref` and `DerefMut` for easy access to the stored type, when it's safe to do so.
To decompose the value inside of the `MovingPtr<T>` into its fields without copying them to the stack, you can use the `deconstruct_moving_ptr!` macro to give you `MovingPtr<U>`s to each field specified:

```rust
struct MySpawnableList<A: Bundle, B: Bundle> {
    a: A,
    b: B,
}
let my_ptr: MovingPtr<'_, MySpawnableList<u32, String>> = ...;
deconstruct_moving_ptr!({
    let MySpawnableList { a, b } = my_ptr;
});
let a_ptr: MovingPtr<'_, u32> = a;
let b_ptr: MovingPtr<'_, String> = b;
```

Similar to `Box::into_inner`, `MovingPtr<T>` also has a method `MovingPtr::read` for moving the whole value out of the pointer onto the stack:

```rust
let a: u32 = a_ptr.read();
let b: String = b_ptr.read();
```

To create a `MovingPtr<T>` from a value, you can use the `move_as_ptr!` macro:

```rust
let my_value = MySpawnableList { a: 42u32, b: "Hello".to_string() };
move_as_ptr!(my_value);
let _: MovingPtr = my_value;
```

This macro works by shadowing the original variable name with the newly created `MovingPtr<T>`.
`MovingPtr<T>` can also be created manually with the `unsafe` method `MovingPtr::from_value`, which takes a `&mut` to an initialized `MaybeUninit<T>`, which the `MovingPtr<T>` takes ownership of: the `MaybeUninit<T>` should be treated as uninitialized after the `MovingPtr<T>` has been used!

To migrate your implementations of `SpawnableList` to the new API, you will want to read the `this` parameter to spawn or insert any bundles stored within:

```rust

impl<R: Relationship> SpawnableList<R> for MySpawnableList<A: Bundle, B: Bundle> {
    // 0.16
    fn spawn(self, world: &mut World, entity: Entity) {
        let MySpawnableList { a, b } = self;
        world.spawn((R::from(entity), a, b));
    }

    // 0.17
    fn spawn(this: MovingPtr<'_, Self>, world: &mut World, entity: Entity) {
        let MySpawnableList { a, b } = this.read();
        world.spawn((R::from(entity), a, b));
    }
}
```

or only read the fields you need with `deconstruct_moving_ptr!`:

```rust
    fn spawn(this: MovingPtr<'_, Self>, world: &mut World, entity: Entity) {
        unsafe {
            // `a` is read, but `b` will be dropped in place without being copied to the stack
            deconstruct_moving_ptr!({
                let MySpawnableList { a, b: _ } = this;
            });
            let a = a.read();
            world.spawn((R::from(entity), a));
        }
    }
```

### Changes to `bevy_tasks` feature flags

{{ heading_metadata(prs=[19019, 20369]) }}

Various feature flags in `bevy_tasks` have been simplified, thanks to the addition of `bevy_platform::cfg`:

- Removed `critical-section` feature (it was just a re-export of bevy_platform anyway)
- Removed `std` and `web` features, relying on `bevy_platform::cfg` to check for availability.
- Added `futures-lite` feature to provide access to the `block_on` implementation from `futures-lite`.
- Added a fallback implementation of `block_on` that just busy-waits.
- Moved `wasm-bindgen` related dependencies out of `bevy_tasks` and moved them into `bevy_platform` under a new exports module.
- Made `async-io` implicit feature explicit.

Any `std`, `web` or `critical-section` feature flags that you've enabled for `bevy_tasks` in your project can simply be removed.

If you need access to `wasm-bindgen` functionality that was previously in `bevy_tasks`, you can find them in `bevy_platform`.
However, note that the re-exports of various web-related crates (`js_sys`, `wasm_bindgen` and `wasm_bindgen_futures`) are not intended for external consumption. Instead, pull your own dependencies to these crates, making sure the version used matches to ensure interoperability.
