{% callout(type="warning") %}
This Guide is currently for a __Release Candidate__ and is subject to change as we work on and improve it. If you notice any errors or issues in the guides, then please submit an issue at [the Bevy website repository issue tracker](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/issues).
{% end %}

The most important changes to be aware of this release are:

- Bevy has reworked its error handling to make it easier to handle `Result`s everywhere. As a result, `Query::single` and friends now return results, rather than panicking.
