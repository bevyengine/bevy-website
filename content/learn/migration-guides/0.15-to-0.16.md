The most important changes to be aware of this release are:

- Bevy has reworked its error handling to make it easier to handle `Result`s everywhere. As a result, `Query::single` and friends now return results, rather than panicking.
- Bevy's ECS now has built-in one-to-many entity relationships. The existing parent-child hierarchy system has been modified to use these relationships, causing minor breaking changes in entity despawning behavior and how children are added / replaced for a parent entity.
- The `bevy` crate now supports `no_std` platforms. As part of this, many items (like `HashMap`) from `bevy_utils` have been moved into `bevy_platform`. If you are the author of an ecosystem crate, you may want to offer `no_std` support to your users as well: it's generally straightforward unless you're interfacing directly with the underlying operating system.
