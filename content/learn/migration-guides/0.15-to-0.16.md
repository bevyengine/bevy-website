The most important changes to be aware of this release are:

- Bevy now prefers `Result`s over panicking, as applications can easily recover from `Result`s instead of crashing. As part of this decision, Bevy's error handling capabilities have been significantly improved. (Systems can easily return `Result`s and a new `BevyError` type has been introduced.) Additionally, several panicking functions have been switched to return a result (`Query::single()`) or have been deprecated completely (`Query::many()`).
