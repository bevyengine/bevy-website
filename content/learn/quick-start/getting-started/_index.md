This section will help you get started on your Bevy journey as quickly as possible. It will walk you through setting up your development environment and writing a simple Bevy app.

## Quick Start

If you want to dive in immediately and you already have a working Rust setup, feel free to follow this "quick start" guide. Otherwise, move on to the next page.

Note: the "fast compiles" setup is on the next page, so you might want to read that section first.

### Try the Examples

1. Clone the [Bevy repo](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy):

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy
    ```

2. Navigate to the new "bevy" folder

    ```sh
    cd bevy
    ```

3. Switch to the correct Bevy version (as the default is the git main development branch)

    ```sh
    # use the latest Bevy release
    git checkout latest
    # or a specific version
    git checkout v0.11.0
    ```

4. Try the examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#examples)

    ```sh
    cargo run --example breakout
    ```

### Add Bevy as a Dependency

Bevy is [available as a library on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy).

The easiest way to add it to your project is to use `cargo add`:

```sh
cargo add bevy
```

Alternatively, you can manually add it to your project's Cargo.toml like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy = "0.12" # make sure this is the latest version
```

Make sure to use the latest `bevy` crate version ([![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bevy.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)).
