I know you are itching to start making games, but we need to do a _small_ amount of setup first.

## Rust Setup

All Bevy app and engine code is written in Rust. This means that before we begin, we need to set up our Rust development environment.

### Installing Rust

Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is "the latest stable release" of Rust.

Install Rust by following the [Rust Getting Started Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

Once this is done, you should have the ```rustc``` compiler and the ```cargo``` build system installed in your path.

### Installing OS Dependencies

#### Linux

Follow the instructions at [Linux Dependencies](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/latest/docs/linux_dependencies.md)

#### Windows

* Run the [Visual Studio 2019 build tools installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16)
* For easy setup, select the ```Desktop development with C++``` workload in the installer.
* For a minimal setup, follow these steps:
    1. In the installer, navigate to `Individual components`
    2. Select the latest `MSVC` for your architecture and version of Windows
    3. Select the latest `Windows SDK` for your version of Windows
    4. Select the `C++ CMake tools` for Windows component
    5. Install the components

#### MacOS

Install the Xcode command line tools with `xcode-select --install` or the [Xcode app](https://apps.apple.com/en/app/xcode/id497799835)

### Code Editor / IDE

You can use any code editor you want, but we highly recommend one that has a [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) plugin. It's still in development, but it already provides top-tier autocomplete and code intelligence. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has an officially supported [rust-analyzer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).

### Rust Learning Resources

The goal of this guide is to get started learning Bevy quickly, so it won't serve as a full Rust education. If you would like to learn more about the Rust language, check out the following resources:

* [**The Rust Book**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): the best place to learn Rust from scratch
* [**Rust by Example**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/): learn Rust by working through live coding examples
* [**Rustlings**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings): learn Rust through a series of fun and interactive exercises

## Create a new Bevy Project

Now we are ready to set up a Bevy project! Bevy is just a normal Rust dependency. You can either add it to an existing Rust project or create a new one. For completeness we will assume you are starting from scratch.

### Create a new Rust executable project

First, navigate to a folder where you want to create your new project. Then, run the following command to create a new folder containing our rust executable project:

```sh
cargo new my_bevy_game
cd my_bevy_game
```

Now run ```cargo run``` to build and run your project. You should see ```Hello, world!``` printed to your terminal. Open the ```my_bevy_game``` folder in your code editor of choice and take some time to look through the files.

```main.rs``` is the entry point of your program:

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

```Cargo.toml``` is your "project file". It contains metadata about your project such as its name, dependencies, and build configuration.

```toml
[package]
name = "my_bevy_game"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
```

### Add Bevy as a dependency

Bevy is [available as a library on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy), the official Rust package repository.

The easiest way to add it to your project is to use `cargo add`:

```sh
cargo add bevy
```

Alternatively, you can manually add it to your project's Cargo.toml like this:

```toml
[package]
name = "my_bevy_game"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021" # this needs to be 2021, or you need to set "resolver=2"

[dependencies]
bevy = "0.13" # make sure this is the latest version
```

Make sure to use the latest `bevy` crate version ([![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bevy.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)).

### Cargo Workspaces

If you are using [Cargo Workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html), you will also need to add the resolver to your Cargo.toml file in the root directory:

```toml
[workspace]
resolver = "2" # Important! wgpu/Bevy needs this!
```

### Compile with Performance Optimizations

While it may not be an issue for simple projects, debug builds in Rust can be _very slow_ - especially when you start using Bevy to make real games.

It's not uncommon for debug builds using the default configuration to take multiple minutes to load large 3D models, or for the framerate for simple scenes to drop to near-unplayable levels.

Fortunately, there is a simple fix, and we don't have to give up our fast iterative compiles! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# Enable a small amount of optimization in debug mode
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 1

# Enable high optimizations for dependencies (incl. Bevy), but not for our code:
[profile.dev.package."*"]
opt-level = 3
```

You might think to simply develop in release mode instead, but we recommend against this as it can worsen the development experience by slowing down recompiles and disabling helpful debug symbols and assertions.

### Enable Fast Compiles (Optional)

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust.
Unfortunately, the compile times are rather long.
This section explains how to speed up iterative compiles: the amount of time it takes to rebuild your project after changing a single file.

#### Dynamic Linking

This is the most impactful compilation time decrease!
You can compile `bevy` as dynamic library, preventing it from having to be statically linked each time you rebuild your project. You can enable this with the `dynamic_linking` feature flag.

```sh
cargo run --features bevy/dynamic_linking
```

If you don't want to add the `--features bevy/dynamic_linking` to each run, this flag can permanently be set with this command (edits `Cargo.toml` for you):

```sh
cargo add bevy -F dynamic_linking
```

{% callout(type="warning") %}
On Windows you must also enable the [performance optimizations](#compile-with-performance-optimizations) or you will get a ["too many exported symbols"](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1110#issuecomment-1312926923) error.
{% end %}

{% callout(type="note") %}
Shipping your game with dynamic linking enabled is not recommended because it requires you to include `libbevy_dylib` alongside your game, it prevents certain optimizations, and can increase the size of your game.
If you remove the `dynamic_linking` feature, your game executable can run standalone.
{% end %}

#### Alternative Linkers

The Rust compiler spends a lot of time in the final "link" step, especially with a massive library like Bevy.
`lld` is _much faster_ at linking than the default Rust linker.
To install LLD, find your OS below and run the given command.

<details>
  <summary>LLD Installation</summary>

* **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install lld clang`
* **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install lld clang`
* **Arch**: `sudo pacman -S lld clang`
* **Windows**: Ensure you have the latest [cargo-binutils](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cargo-binutils) as this lets commands like `cargo run` use the LLD linker automatically.

  ```sh
  cargo install -f cargo-binutils
  rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
  ```

* **MacOS**: On MacOS, the default system linker `ld-prime` is faster than LLD.

</details>

Then, add one of the following to your Cargo config at `/path/to/project/.cargo/config.toml` (where `/path/to/project` is the directory which contains `Cargo.toml`) depending on your OS:

```toml
# for Linux
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = "clang"
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"]

# for Windows
[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
linker = "rust-lld.exe"
```

<details>
  <summary>Alternative - Mold</summary>
  
Mold is _up to 5Ã— (five times!) faster_ than LLD, but with a few caveats like limited platform support and occasional stability issues.  To install mold, find your OS below and run the given command:

* **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install mold clang`
* **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install mold clang`
* **Arch**: `sudo pacman -S mold clang`
* **Windows**: Support not planned; [See this tracking issue](https://github.com/rui314/mold/issues/1069#issuecomment-1653436823) for more information.
* **MacOS**: Available as [sold](https://github.com/bluewhalesystems/sold), but this is unnecessary since the default linker is just as fast.

You will also need to add the following to your Cargo config at `/path/to/project/.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = "clang"
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=/usr/bin/mold"]
```

{% callout(type="note") %}
Disabling `bevy/dynamic_linking` may improve Mold's performance.

#### Nightly Rust Compiler

This gives access to the latest performance improvements and "unstable" optimizations, including [generic sharing](#generic-sharing) below.

Create a ```rust-toolchain.toml``` file in the root of your project, next to ```Cargo.toml```.

```toml
[toolchain]
channel = "nightly"
```

For more information, see [The rustup book: Overrides](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file).

#### Generic Sharing

Allows crates to share monomorphized generic code instead of duplicating it.
In some cases this allows us to "precompile" generic code so it doesn't affect iterative compiles.
This is currently only available on nightly Rust ([see above](#nightly-rust-compiler)).

<details>
  <summary>Generic sharing setup</summary>

See [this file](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/latest/.cargo/config_fast_builds.toml) for a more comprehensive, cross-platform example.

```toml
# /path/to/project/.cargo/config.toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
rustflags = [
  # (Nightly) Make the current crate share its generic instantiations
  "-Zshare-generics=y",
]
```

</details>

### Build Bevy

Now run `cargo run` again. The Bevy dependencies should start building. This will take some time as you are essentially building an engine from scratch. You will only need to do a full rebuild once. Every build after this one will be fast!

Now that we have our Bevy project set up, we're ready to start making our first Bevy app!
