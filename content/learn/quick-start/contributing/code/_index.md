Would you like to contribute code to Bevy?  Here's how!

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the [`bevyengine/bevy` repository on GitHub][bevy], you'll need to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.*
2. Make your changes in a local clone of your fork
3. For a higher chance of CI passing the first time, consider locally running `cargo run -p ci`. You can run the commands manually:
   1. `cargo fmt --all -- --check`  (remove `--check` to let the command fix found problems)
   2. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -A clippy::type_complexity -A clippy::manual-strip`
   3. `cargo test --all-targets --workspace`
4. Push your changes to your fork and open a [Pull Request][pull]
5. Respond to any CI failures or review feedback.

Remember to follow Bevy's [Code of Conduct][coc], and thanks for contributing!

*The same steps apply for any other repository in the [Bevy organization][bevyorg] that you would like to contribute to.
