class=page-with-menu__content><div class=docs-page><div class=docs-content><h1>Triage</h1><div class=media-content><p>Bevy's scope and user base means that it gets a large volume of issues and pull requests. This work all needs to be organized to make it easier to find related issues, figure out where you can help, and to quickly communicate the status of a task at a glance. The continual process of organizing work is called <strong>triage</strong>.<h2 id=classifying-issues-and-prs>Classifying Issues and PRs</h2><p>Labels are our primary tool for organizing work. Here are a few of the most common, organized by category:<ul><li><strong>A</strong>: Area (e.g. <code>A-Animation</code>, <code>A-ECS</code>, <code>A-Rendering</code>, ...).<li><strong>C</strong>: Category. The most common include: <ul><li><code>C-Bug</code>: unexpected or incorrect behavior.<li><code>C-Feature</code>: a new feature, making something new possible.<li><code>C-Docs</code>: an addition or correction to the documentation.<li><code>C-Code-Quality</code>: a section of code that is hard to understand or change.<li><code>C-Performance</code>: a change motivated by speed, memory usage, or compile times.<li><code>C-Tracking-Issue</code>: collects information on a broad development initiative.</ul><li><strong>D</strong>: Difficulty. This can either be the estimated level of expertise (not time) to solve an issue or review a pull request. In order, these are: <ul><li><code>D-Trivial</code>: typos, obviously incorrect one-line bug fixes, code reorganization, and renames.<li><code>D-Straightforward</code>: simple bug fixes, API improvements, docs, tests, and examples.<li><code>D-Modest</code>: new features, refactors, and challenging bug fixes.<li><code>D-Complex</code>: rewrites and unusually complex features.<li>The <code>D-Domain-Expert</code> and <code>D-Domain-Agnostic</code> labels are modifiers, which describe if unusually high or low degrees of domain-specific knowledge are required.<li>The <code>D-Unsafe</code> label is applied to any code that touches <code>unsafe</code> Rust, which requires special skills and scrutiny.</ul><li><strong>O</strong>: Operating System (e.g. O-Linux, O-Web, O-Windows, ...).<li><strong>P</strong>: Priority (e.g. P-Critical, P-High, ...). <ul><li>Most work is not explicitly categorized by priority; volunteer work mostly occurs on an ad hoc basis depending on contributor interests.</ul><li><strong>S</strong>: Status. The most common include: <ul><li><code>S-Ready-For-Implementation</code>: this issue is ready for someone to pick it up and open a PR!<li><code>S-Needs-Triage</code>: this issue needs to be labeled.<li><code>S-Needs-Reproduction</code>: this issue needs a reproducible example to allow fixes to be tested.<li><code>S-Adopt-Me</code>: the original PR author has no intent to complete the PR, and it should be adopted by another contributor. This PR should be closed, and have an issue linked to track its adoption.<li><code>S-Blocked</code>: cannot move forward until something else changes.<li><code>S-Needs-Review</code>: this PR needs reviewer attention to move forward.<li><code>S-Waiting-On-Author</code>: the author needs to make changes to this PR before it can be approved.<li><code>S-Ready-For-Final-Review</code>: this PR has been approved by the community and is ready for a Maintainer to consider merging it.<li><code>S-Needs-Help</code>: this PR is almost ready to be merged but blocked on a technical issue. Helping to fix it is welcomed.<li><code>S-Nominated-To-Close</code>: the triage team feels this PR or issue should no longer be considered, but for any reason are leaving it open for further discussion. The triage team will document their reasoning, and if you disagree please feel free to continue the discussion!</ul><li><strong>X</strong>: Controversiality. In order, these are: <ul><li><code>X-Uncontroversial</code>: everyone should agree that this is a good idea.<li><code>X-Contentious</code>: there's real design thought needed to ensure that this is the right path forward.<li><code>X-Controversial</code>: there's active disagreement and / or large-scale architectural implications involved.<li><code>X-Blessed</code>: work that was previously controversial, but whose controversial (but perhaps not technical) elements have been endorsed by the relevant decision makers.</ul><li><strong>M</strong>: Meta, for supporting work that needs to be done. <ul><li><code>M-Release-Note</code>: work that should be called out in the blog post due to impact. This decision is usually made by Maintainers, but feel free to nominate a change in the comments if you think it deserves the spotlight!<li><code>M-Migration-Guide</code>: this is a breaking change to Bevy's public API, and requires advice on how to migrate existing code. These changes cannot be shipped in minor versions!</ul></ul><p>Check Github for a complete and up-to-date list with descriptions at <a href=https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/labels>the engine repo</a> or <a href=https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/labels>the website repo</a>. You can learn more about labels on <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels>GitHub's documentation</a>.<p><a href=https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/helping-out/reviewing-pull-requests/#how-pull-requests-are-merged>The rules for how PRs get merged</a> depend on their classification by controversy and difficulty. More difficult PRs will require more careful review from experts, while more controversial PRs will require rewrites to reduce the costs involved and / or sign-off from Subject Matter Experts and Maintainers.<p>When making PRs, try to split out more controversial changes from less controversial ones, in order to make your work easier to review and merge. Also consider splitting simple changes from complex ones, since the simple changes can be reviewed and merged much quicker.<h3 id=examples>Examples</h3><p>Some reasons to apply <code>X-Controversial</code> or <code>X-Contentious</code> include:<ol><li>Changes to a project-wide workflow or style.<li>New architecture for a large feature.<li>Serious tradeoffs were made.<li>Heavy user impact.<li>New ways for users to make mistakes (footguns).<li>Adding a new dependency of unknown repute.<li>Touching licensing information (due to the level of precision required).<li>Adding root-level files and folders (due to the high level of visibility).</ol><p>Keep in mind that <code>X-Contentious</code> is a lesser form of <code>X-Controversial</code>. If you create a PR that <em>might</em> be controversial but no one has objected to yet, consider adding <code>X-Contentious</code> so reviewers take extra care to consider the consequences.<p>Some reasons to apply <code>X-Uncontroversial</code> include:<ul><li>Fixing typos, grammar, and dead links.<li>Removing dead code or unused dependencies.<li>Fixing <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/>Clippy</a> lints and warnings.</ul><p>Some reasons to apply <code>D-Complex</code> include:<ol><li>High levels of technical complexity.<li>Introduction or modification of soundness-relevant code. (If it touches <code>unsafe</code>, be sure to add <code>D-Unsafe</code> as well!)<li>Large-scale code reoganization, where it is easy to miss small changes.</ol><p>Some reasons to apply <code>D-Trivial</code> include:<ol><li>Single-line changes.<li>Moving a file from one location to another.<li>Small changes to documentation or error messages.</ol><p>Some reasons to apply <code>S-Nominated-to-Close</code> include:<ol><li>The PR is no longer needed.<li>The PR has serious flaws and has not attracted any support from reviewers.<li>The PR shows signs that it was AI generated, which is a volation of our <a href=/learn/contribute/policies/ai>AI Policy</a>.</ol><p>Remember that difficulty labels are for expertise required to either solve an issue or review a pull request. By labeling an issue as <code>D-Trivial</code>, you are marking it as a good first issue for new contributors to the Bevy project.<h2 id=closing-prs-and-issues>Closing PRs and Issues</h2><p>From time to time, PRs are unsuitable to be merged in a way that cannot be readily fixed. Rather than leaving these PRs open in limbo indefinitely, they should simply be closed.<p>This might happen if:<ol><li>The PR is spam or malicious.<li>The work has already been done elsewhere or is otherwise fully obsolete.<li>The PR was successfully adopted.<li>The work is particularly low quality, and the author is resistant to coaching.<li>The work adds features or abstraction of limited value, especially in a way that could easily be recreated outside of the engine.<li>The work has been sitting in review for so long and accumulated so many conflicts that it needs substantial work to get it in a correct state.<li>The PR is pointlessly large, and should be broken into multiple smaller PRs for easier review.<li>The PR is controversial and hasn't seen activity in the last 6 months.</ol><p>There are several paths for PRs to be closed:<ol><li>Authors may close their own PRs for any reason at any time.<li>If a PR is clearly spam or malicious, anyone with triage rights is encouraged to close out the PR and report it to GitHub.<li>If the work has already been done elsewhere, adopted, or otherwise obsoleted, anyone with triage rights is encouraged to close out the PR with an explanatory comment.<li>Anyone may nominate a PR for closure, by bringing it to the attention of the author and / or one of the SMEs / Maintainers. Let them press the button, but this is generally well-received and helpful.<li>SMEs or Maintainers may, and are encouraged, to unilaterally close PRs that fall into one or more of the remaining categories.<li>In the case of PRs where some members of the community, other than the author, are in favor, and some are opposed, any two relevant SMEs or Maintainers may act in concert to close the PR.<li>For a PR that has been sitting for a while and became bitrotten, check with the original author if they intend to continue working on it. If not, or without a response, the PR can be labeled with <code>S-Adopt-Me</code>, and closed. Tracking adoption progress will happen in a linked issue.<li>Inactive <code>X-Controversial</code> can be closed if relevant SMEs or Maintainers have decided there's no more interest for it. If it's still interesting and controversial, a decision must be made.<li>Majority AI-Generated PRs cannot be merged as per the Bevy org's <a href=/learn/contribute/policies/ai>AI policy</a>. Please mark these PRs as <code>S-Nominated-to-Close</code> for maintainers to make a final decision.</ol><p>When closing a PR, check if it has an issue linked. If it does not, you should strongly consider creating an issue and linking the now-closed PR to help make sure the previous work can be discovered and credited.<h2 id=milestones-roadmaps-and-work-planning>Milestones, Roadmaps and Work Planning</h2><p>Bevy is, to a large degree, a project powered by volunteers, each with their own motivations and goals. The usual estimation and long-term planning difficulties of software are amplified dramatically: this is why Bevy does not maintain a central roadmap.<p>Despite this, some degree of work planning is important, as both a coordination and quality control mechanism. This is generally fairly decentralized and organic, relying on temporary, focused working groups and milestones.<p>Each release (both major and minor) has an <a href=https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/milestones>associated milestone</a>. For example, the 0.5 milestone would be for the major Bevy version 0.5 release, while the 0.5.1 milestone would be for a minor patch release for Bevy 0.5.<p>Minor version milestones are intended for work and issues that are either particularly critical to backport fixes for, or extremely low risk non-breaking improvements (such as documentation improvements or simple methods). When enough changes have accumulated, maintainers will create a new branch for the minor version, cherrypicking merged PRs in that milestone onto that branch and then publishing it. Breaking changes cannot be shipped in a minor version (due to semantic versioning), and complex changes are both hard to cherrypick and challenging to use.<p>By contrast, major version milestones serve three purposes:<ol><li>Tracking high-value, ready-to-implement or reviewable work that would be useful for contributors to tackle this cycle.<li>Coordinating complex efforts that would be good to ship in a single cycle to avoid shipping half-complete features or refactors.<li>Ensuring that we do not ship major bugs, shoddy documentation or inconsistent APIs.</ol><p>At the start of each release cycle, the milestone will tend towards the first two use cases. As we near the end, the milestone is gradually trimmed down to only the most critical problems that would justify delaying a release. It's common to move issues and PRs that are near completion or still helpful to implement into the milestone for the major release after the current milestone.<p>Members of the triage team should follow these guidelines for how we use milestones, but are encouraged to add, remove and modify milestones for various work, based on their own subjective judgement of the importance of the work, how well it aligns with our current collective goals, and its current state. When you assign work to a milestone (or take it out of it), try to leave a short comment justifying why you have done so, so others can understand (and perhaps argue with) your rationale.<h2 id=triage-team>Triage Team</h2><p>Members of the Triage Team within the Bevy organization have permissions to label and close issues, though they do not have merge rights or special authority.
