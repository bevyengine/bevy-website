## Support Bevy

Bevy will always be free and open-source, but it isn't free to make! Because Bevy is free, we rely on the generosity of the Bevy community to fund our efforts. If you are a happy user of Bevy or you believe in our mission, please consider [donating to the Bevy Foundation](/donate)... every bit helps!
